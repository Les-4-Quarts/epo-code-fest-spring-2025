an\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0c7 \\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n8 \\n\\nalarm accessory for a mobile device. In general, a mobile\\ndevice,  e.g.,  a  cellular  telephone  (phone)  or  a  mobile\\nphone, can be modified (e.g., attached to an accessory\\nand/or  through  the  use  of  specialized  software  on  the\\nmobile device), to respond to one or more predetermined\\nconditions to automatically, and/or with user interaction,\\ntrigger an alarm and thereby draw attention to that per-\\nson’s present circumstances in order to seek help and/or\\nscare away a potential threat. Accordingly, this document\\ndescribes, among other things, an accessory that can be\\nattached  to  the  mobile  device  and  provide  enhanced\\nsafety functionality to a user of the mobile device. Various\\nconfigurations of such a mobile accessory device and its\\nuse are described herein, and may include various com-\\nbinations  of  the  following  features  and/or  functionality.\\nThe accessory may be embodied in many different forms\\nand should not be construed as limited to the implemen-\\ntations set forth herein. As used in the specification, and\\nin the appended claims, the singular forms \"a\", \"an\", \"the\",\\ninclude plural variations unless the  context clearly  dic-\\ntates otherwise.\\n[0015] As illustrated in FIGS. 1-6, the present disclo-\\nsure relates to a mobile accessory device 100, also re-\\nferred to a mobile accessory device. The mobile acces-\\nsory device 100 may be configured for use with a mobile\\ndevice such as a mobile phone 200 or other mobile device\\n(e.g., tablet computer, notebook computer, etc.). In par-\\nticular, the mobile accessory device 100 may be config-\\nured to engage (e.g., adhere to or otherwise be physically\\njoined to) the mobile phone 200. The mobile accessory\\ndevice 100 may be configured to engage any portion of\\nthe mobile phone 200, such as  the rear surface of the\\nhousing of the mobile phone 200. In some embodiments,\\nthe mobile accessory device 100 may be a stand-alone\\ndevice that does not physically engage to a mobile de-\\nvice.\\nIn  one  implementation,  the  mobile  accessory\\n[0016]\\ndevice 100 may include a housing 102. The housing 102\\nmay  define  an  attachment  (e.g.,  locking)  surface  104\\n(see, FIG. 2) and an outer surface 106 (see, e.g., FIG.\\n1). As illustrated in FIG. 2, the attachment surface 104\\nmay be configured to engage a rear surface 202 of the\\nmobile phone 200 opposite from a front surface 204 at\\nwhich  a  display  is  positioned.  Thereby,  the  mobile  ac-\\ncessory  device  100  does  not  block  the  display  in  this\\nconfiguration. Further, the mobile accessory device 100\\nmay occupy less than an entirety of an area of the rear\\nsurface 202 of the mobile phone 200. Thereby, the mobile\\naccessory device 100 may not block any rear-facing cam-\\nera thereon. Further, by providing the mobile accessory\\ndevice 100 with a relatively small size, the mobile acces-\\nsory  may  be  attached  to  mobile  phones  with  differing\\nsizes and shapes. Further, the mobile accessory device\\n100 may be configured to not extend to the edges of the\\nmobile  phone  200,  such  that  an  edge  protecting  case\\nmay be employed with the mobile phone. As may be un-\\nderstood, the mobile accessory may also be configured\\nto engage a case for the mobile phone that includes a\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n35\\n\\n40\\n\\n45\\n\\n50\\n\\n55\\n\\n5\\n\\nrear portion that covers the rear surface (see, e.g., FIGS.\\n21 and 22). In another embodiment, the mobile acces-\\nsory  may  itself  comprise  a  case  for  the  mobile  phone\\n(see, e.g., FIG. 11).\\n[0017] The attachment surface 104 of the housing 102\\nmay be configured to substantially permanently engage\\nthe rear surface 202 of the mobile phone 200, or a case\\npositioned at the rear  surface  as noted above.  For ex-\\nample, the mobile accessory device 100 may include an\\nadhesive  at  the  attachment  surface  104  configured  to\\nadhere to the rear surface 202 of the mobile phone 200.\\nThereby, the mobile accessory device 100 may be con-\\nfigured for use over the lifetime of the mobile phone 200,\\nthereby ensuring that the mobile accessory is available\\nat all times the mobile phone is in the user’s possession.\\nAlternatively, the attachment surface 104 of the housing\\n102 may be configured to releasably engage (e.g., using\\na slot-tab arrangement, or hook and loop connecting sur-\\nfaces  such  as  VELCRO®)  the  rear  surface  202  of  the\\nmobile phone 200, or a case positioned at the rear sur-\\nface as noted above.\\n[0018] As  illustrated  in  FIG.  4,  the  mobile  accessory\\ndevice 100 may include a power source 108, which may\\nbe a battery. Further, the housing 102 may include a bat-\\ntery portion 110 that is configured to receive the power\\nsource 108. The battery portion 110 may be removable\\nto allow for replacement of the power source 108. The\\npower source 108 may be configured to provide electrical\\npower to each of the components of the mobile accessory\\ndevice 100 such that the mobile accessory is self-pow-\\nered. However, as may be understood, in another imple-\\nmentation  the  mobile  accessory  may  be  configured  to\\nreceive electrical power from the mobile phone. For ex-\\nample,  the  mobile  accessory  may  include  a connector\\nthat engages a power port or a headphone jack on the\\nmobile phone. Alternatively, or in addition, the mobile ac-\\ncessory may draw power from the phone wirelessly via\\na technique akin to QI® inductive charging, but in reverse\\n(e.g., reverse wireless charging, wireless power sharing).\\n[0019] Additional  control  circuitry  components  of  the\\nmobile accessory device 100 and the mobile phone 200\\nare schematically illustrated in FIG. 7. As illustrated, the\\nmobile accessory device 100 includes a controller 112,\\nwhich may be at least partially received in the housing\\n102. The controller 112 is in communication with the mo-\\nbile  phone  200  (e.g.,  a  communications  connection,\\nBLUETOOTH, USB) for providing signals to the mobile\\nphone 200, for example, to request, trigger, command,\\nor otherwise control operation of at least some operation\\nor actions of the mobile phone 200. The controller 112\\nmay include an audio output device 114 such as a speak-\\ner and a light output device 116 such as a light emitting\\ndiode (LED) or xenon strobe. Example positions and con-\\nfigurations of the audio output device 114 and the light\\noutput device 116 are illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 3-6.\\n[0020] As further illustrated in FIG. 7, the control cir-\\ncuitry of the mobile accessory device 100 includes a user\\nseparation sensor arrangement 118 (e.g., proximity de-\\n\\n\\x0c9 \\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n10 \\n\\ntector).  The  user  separation  sensor  arrangement  118\\nmay  include  a  wearable  component  120  configured  to\\nengage  (e.g.,  donned  by,  worn  by)  a  user  and  a  user\\ninput sensor 122 (e.g., a user input apparatus) engaged\\nwith the housing 102 and in communication with the con-\\ntroller 112. The controller 112 may be configured to ac-\\ntivate and/or perform one or more predetermined oper-\\nations in response to the user input sensor 122’s deter-\\nmining  that  the  wearable  component  120  exceeds  a\\nthreshold separation distance therefrom, and/or has be-\\ncome detached (e.g., mechanically separated) from the\\nmobile  accessory device  100, e.g.,  providing  an  alarm\\nsignal to indicate that separation between the mobile ac-\\ncessory  device  100  and  the  wearable  component  120\\nhas occurred, in response to which one or more actions\\ncan occur-e.g., sounding an audible alarm on the acces-\\nsory, emitting light from a light source on the accessory,\\ncause the attached phone’s flash light to turn on or strobe,\\ncause the attached phone to transmit a message via text\\nand/or phone call, cause the mobile phone to emit sound,\\ncause the mobile phone to take photos or begin recording\\nvideo,  either  through the forward-facing  camera or the\\nrearward-facing  camera  or  the  both,  or  otherwise  any\\noperation  within  the  attached  phone’s  functionalities.\\nNote that any phone-based action could be achieved by\\nthe accessory’s transmitting to the mobile phone that an\\nalarm condition has been detected, e.g., in response to\\nthe user’s pushing a button on the accessory, or in re-\\nsponse to the proximity between the accessory and the\\nwearable component being exceeded and/or in response\\nto the wearable component being mechanically discon-\\nnected from the accessory.\\n[0021] As further illustrated in FIG. 7, the control cir-\\ncuitry  of  the  mobile  accessory  device  100  includes  a\\nsound detector arrangement 150 (e.g., a sound detection\\ncircuit). The sound  detector arrangement 150 includes\\ncircuitry that is configured to receive sound signals from\\na  microphone  152  and  identify  one  or  more  predeter-\\nmined sounds. The controller 112 is configured to provide\\none or  more  predetermined actions  in response  to the\\nidentification  of  one  or  more  corresponding sounds. In\\nsome implementations, the sound detector arrangement\\n150 can be configured to recognize one or more utter-\\nances (e.g., words, phrases, or other sounds produced\\nby a user). In some implementations, the sound detector\\narrangement 150 can be configured to recognize one or\\nmore non-spoken sounds (e.g., screams or other sounds\\nof  distress,  smoke  alarms,  glass  breakage,  car  crash\\nsounds). The controller 112 may be configured to activate\\nand/or perform one or more predetermined operations in\\nresponse to the sound detector arrangement identifica-\\ntion of a predetermined command or sound, e.g., provid-\\ning an alarm signal in response to the user saying \"help!\"\\nor \"call 911!\" or screaming, in response to which one or\\nmore actions can occur-e.g., sounding an audible alarm\\non  the accessory,  emitting  light  from a  light  source  on\\nthe accessory, causing the attached phone’s flash light\\nto turn on or strobe, causing the attached phone to trans-\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n35\\n\\n40\\n\\n45\\n\\n50\\n\\n55\\n\\n6\\n\\nmit  a  message  via  text  and/or  phone  call,  causing  the\\nmobile phone to emit sound, causing the mobile phone\\nto take photos or begin recording video, either through\\nthe forward-facing camera or the rearward-facing cam-\\nera  or  the  both,  or  otherwise  any  operation  within  the\\nattached  phone’s  functionalities.  Note  that  any  phone-\\nbased action could be achieved by the accessory’s trans-\\nmitting to the mobile phone that an alarm condition has\\nbeen detected, e.g., in response to the user’s pushing a\\nbutton on the accessory, or in response to the proximity\\nbetween the accessory and the wearable component be-\\ning exceeded and/or in response to the wearable com-\\nponent being mechanically disconnected from the acces-\\nsory, and/or in response to detection of a predetermined\\nsound.\\nIn  some  implementations,  the  controller  112\\n[0022]\\nmay  be configured  to activate  a function of  the  mobile\\nphone 200 in response to the sound detector arrange-\\nment identification of a predetermined sound. For exam-\\nple, the mobile phone 200 may be configured with a voice\\nassistant  (e.g.,  GOOGLE  ASSISTANT,  SIRI,  ALEXA,\\nCORTANA,  BIXBY),  and  the  sound  detector  arrange-\\nment 150  can be configured to recognize  one or  more\\n\"wake up\" phrases associated with voice assistants that\\nare installed on the mobile phone 200 (e.g., \"ok Google\",\\n\"hey  Siri\",  \"Alexa\",  \"hey  Cortana\",  \"hi  Bixby\"),  and  the\\naccessory 100 can send a command to the mobile phone\\n200 that will activate the corresponding voice assistant\\nto process the rest of the user’s command. In some im-\\nplementations, the microphone 152 may be configured\\nas a supplement or substitute for the microphone 211.\\nIn some implementations, the mobile accessory device\\n100 can unlock access to a voice assistant on the mobile\\nphone 200. For example, some configurations of mobile\\nphones and/or voice assistants may require the user to\\nfirst unlock the mobile phone or perform some other pre-\\nliminary action before a voice assistant can respond to\\nverbal commands. The mobile accessory device 100 can\\nrecognize a \"wake up\" word/phrase and send a command\\nto the mobile phone 200, where an application running\\nin the background on the mobile phone 200 can receive\\nthe  command  and  respond  by  unlocking  the  mobile\\nphone 200 and/or otherwise placing the voice assistant\\nin condition to respond to the user. In some implemen-\\ntations, the user can choose to opt-in to grant the phone\\napplication sufficient security privileges to bypass or oth-\\nerwise  release  phone  security  features  (e.g.,  screen\\nlocks)  that  need  to  be  dismissed  in  order  to  make  the\\nvoice assistant responsive and/or useful.\\n[0023] With regard to wearable components, as illus-\\ntrated in FIG. 5, in one embodiment the wearable com-\\nponent 120 may comprise a wrist strap. Initially, the user\\ninput  sensor  122  and  the  wearable  component  120  of\\nthe  user  separation  sensor  arrangement  118  may  be\\nphysically connected. For example, as illustrated in FIG.\\n5, a lanyard 124 (e.g., mechanical tether) may connect\\nthe wearable component 120 to the housing  102 via a\\nconnector 126.\\n\\n\\x0c11 \\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n12 \\n\\n[0024] As noted above, the controller 112 may be ac-\\ntivated  in response  to receipt of  a  signal generated by\\nthe user separation sensor arrangement 118 when the\\nuser separation sensor arrangement 118 determines that\\nthe wearable component 120 has become physically de-\\ntached from the accessory, and/or exceeds a threshold\\nseparation  distance  from  the  user  input  sensor  122.\\nThereby, the threshold separation distance may be de-\\nfined between the housing 102 and the wearable com-\\nponent 120. Thus, for example, the lanyard 124 may have\\na predetermined length that at least partially defines the\\nthreshold distance, and the lanyard may be configured\\nto mechanically and/or electrically attach to the housing\\n102 and separate from  the  housing 102 when the dis-\\ntance  between  the  wearable  component  120  and  the\\nhousing  102  exceeds  the  predetermined  length  of  the\\nlanyard  124. The  user  separation  sensor  arrangement\\n118 can include a user input sensor configured to deter-\\nmine whether the housing 102 and the lanyard are me-\\nchanically and/or electrically separated and provide an\\nalarm signal in response.\\n[0025] As illustrated in FIG. 6, when a user’s wrist to\\nwhich the wearable component 120 is attached moves\\naway from the housing 102 of the mobile accessory de-\\nvice 100 by a distance exceeding the length of the lanyard\\n124, the lanyard may pull out (e.g., separate, break away)\\nthe connector 126 from the housing 102 and out of en-\\ngagement with the user input sensor 122, thereby acti-\\nvating the controller 112 (see, FIG. 7).\\n[0026] Further, in one embodiment the connector 126\\nmay include a whistle. Thereby, once the connector 126\\nis removed from the housing 102, the user may blow on\\nthe whistle to bring attention to the user’s circumstances,\\nscare away an assailant, and/or summon help.\\nIn an alternate embodiment, the connector ex-\\n[0027]\\ntending from the wearable component may be configured\\nto engage a power and/or data port of the mobile phone\\nor  a  headphone  jack  thereon.  In  this  embodiment,  the\\nmobile phone may itself (e.g., via a software application\\nexecuting  on  the  mobile  phone)  detect  detachment  or\\nseparation of the wearable component from the port or\\njack, thereby activating the alarm device.\\n[0028] As schematically illustrated in FIG. 7, the mobile\\naccessory  device  100  may  also  include  a  switch  128.\\nThe switch 128 may be provided in addition to, or as an\\nalternate  for,  the  user  separation  sensor  arrangement\\n118. In a preferred embodiment, both the user separation\\nsensor arrangement 118 and the switch 128 are provid-\\ned.\\n[0029] An example embodiment of  the  switch 128 is\\nillustrated in FIGS. 1 and 3-6. In some embodiments it\\nmay be desirable to provide the switch 128 with features\\nconfigured to prevent accidental actuation thereof so as\\nto avoid accidental activation of the controller 112 (see,\\nFIG. 7). In this regard, in some embodiments actuation\\nof the switch 128 may require movement of the switch\\nalong a non-linear path. For example, FIG. 8 illustrates\\nan enlarged example embodiment of an embodiment of\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n35\\n\\n40\\n\\n45\\n\\n50\\n\\n55\\n\\n7\\n\\nthe switch 128A. As illustrated, the switch 128A may in-\\nclude a center button 130 and a slider 132. In order to\\nactivate the switch 128A, a user may slide the slider 132\\nin order to depress the center button 130. Thereby, issues\\nwith respect to accident actuation of the switch 128A may\\nbe  mitigated.  Various  other  switches  requiring  multi-\\nstage actuation may be provided in other embodiments.\\n[0030] The controller 112 may be configured to be ac-\\ntivated in response to a signal from the user separation\\nsensor arrangement 118 and/or the switch 128. The par-\\nticular response by the controller 112 may be set as de-\\nsired. In some embodiments activation of the controller\\n112 by the switch 128 may result in the same response\\nas activation of the alarm device by the user separation\\nsensor  arrangement  118.  However,  in  other  embodi-\\nments activation of the controller 112 by the switch 128\\nmay result in a different response as compared to acti-\\nvation of the alarm device by the user separation sensor\\narrangement 118.\\n[0031] For example, the controller 112 may be config-\\nured  to  output  an  audible  alarm  configured  to  output\\nsounds,  predetermined  spoken  words,  and/or  noises\\n(e.g., siren, buzzer, bell, speech) that are loud enough\\nto attract attention from others in the vicinity of the mobile\\nphone  200  when  the  user  separation  sensor  arrange-\\nment 118 determines that the threshold separation dis-\\ntance is exceeded. In this regard, one or both of the audio\\noutput device 114 and the light output device 116 may\\nbe activated. However, in some configurations, the con-\\ntroller 112 may be silently activated when the switch 128\\nis actuated (e.g., the controller 112 or the mobile phone\\n200 may be configured to omit the emission of an atten-\\ntion-getting  sound  during  activation).  In  some  embodi-\\nments, a silent alarm can refer to any appropriate circuit\\nand/or mechanism for taking a predetermined action in\\nresponse to a trigger, and does not necessarily require\\n(nor preclude) that the alarm device is itself incapable of\\ngenerating an audible alarm.\\nIn this regard, the controller 112 may be config-\\n[0032]\\nured to direct the mobile phone 200 to send a communi-\\ncation (e.g., a telephone call, an SMS text message, an\\ninstant message, and email) to one or more predefined\\nrecipients in response to actuation of the switch 128. In\\nsome implementations, the communication can include\\none or more predetermined messages (e.g., pre-record-\\ned  voice  message,  pre-configured  text  or  synthesized\\nvoice message). In some implementations, the commu-\\nnication can be sent to one or more predetermined re-\\ncipients (e.g., emergency response center, 911, police,\\nuser contacts). The controller 112 may be configured to\\ndirect the mobile phone 200 to send a communication to\\none or more predefined recipients when the user sepa-\\nration  sensor  arrangement  118  determines  that  the\\nthreshold separation distance from the wearable compo-\\nnent 120 is exceeded, and/or that the wearable compo-\\nnent 120 has become detached from the mobile acces-\\nsory device 100.\\n[0033] The controller 112 may be configured to direct\\n\\n\\x0c13 \\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n14 \\n\\nthe mobile phone 200 to activate a camera 207 (e.g., to\\ncapture still or motion video of the surroundings), a mi-\\ncrophone 211 (e.g., to capture sounds in the surrounding\\nenvironment),  a  position  location  detector  system  154\\n(e.g., GPS or other location system to identify a local or\\nglobal location of the phone), light output system to emit\\na visual indicator (e.g., blink an onboard LED, flash the\\nphone’s screen), and/or audio output system (e.g., built-\\nin speaker of the phone, to emit an audible alarm or call\\nfor help) of the mobile phone 200, In some implementa-\\ntions, the communication can include one or more of a\\ndistress  message,  positioning  coordinates  of  a  deter-\\nmined position location (e.g., based on a GPS sensor in\\nthe mobile device), audio captured by mobile device, and\\nvideo captured by the mobile device. The functionality of\\nbeing able to send a communication in response to an\\nalarm  or  other  predetermined condition  may  be imple-\\nmented by specialized software installed on and execut-\\ned by  the mobile device, for example, a downloadable\\nsoftware application (e.g., app) or other software com-\\nponent.\\n[0034] To transmit such notifications, as schematically\\nillustrated  in  FIG.  7,  the  mobile  accessory  device  100\\nmay  further  comprise  a  communication  interface  134\\n(e.g., a communication circuit, communication circuitry).\\nThe communication interface 134 may be configured to\\ncommunicate with a communication interface 206 (e.g.,\\na communication circuit, communication circuitry) of the\\nmobile phone 200 when directed by the controller 112.\\nThe communication interface 134 of the mobile acces-\\nsory device 100 and the communication interface 206 of\\nthe mobile phone 200 may be any suitable arrangement,\\nsuch as a device or circuitry embodied in either hardware,\\nsoftware, or a combination thereof that is configured to\\nreceive and/or transmit data. The communication inter-\\nfaces 134, 206 may be configured to receive and/or trans-\\nmit data via a wired communication connection or wire-\\nless communication connection. In this regard, the com-\\nmunication interfaces 134, 206 may include, for example,\\nan antenna and supporting wireless transmitter, receiver,\\nor  transceiver  hardware  and/or hardwired components\\nand/or software. For example, the communication inter-\\nface 134 of the mobile accessory device 100 may include\\na wireless transmitter, receiver, or transceiver configured\\nto communicate with the communication interface 206 of\\nthe mobile phone 200 via BLUETOOTH, photonic (e.g.,\\ninfrared, IRDA), acoustic, ultrasonic, ZigBee, WiFi, or any\\nother  appropriate  communication  format.  Further,  the\\ncommunication  interface  206  of  the  mobile  phone  200\\nmay be configured to communicate with one or more cel-\\nlular networks via any known communication standard.\\n[0035] Thereby,  the  communication  interface  206  of\\nthe mobile phone 200 may send a communication to one\\nor more designated contacts. The designated contacts\\nmay be selected by the user via a user-installable soft-\\nware application that may be loaded on the mobile phone\\n200. The type and/or content of the message may also\\nbe configured within the application.\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n35\\n\\n40\\n\\n45\\n\\n50\\n\\n55\\n\\n8\\n\\nIn some embodiments, the communication may\\n[0036]\\ninclude a phone call with an audible message. For ex-\\nample, a prerecorded message may be played to convey\\na request for help. Alternatively or additionally, the mobile\\nphone 200 may activate a microphone 211 thereof such\\nthat a recipient of the call may receive audio relating to\\nthe user of mobile accessory’s circumstances (e.g., voice\\nor other sounds corresponding to words or actions of the\\nmobile phone user or anyone or anything else within the\\nrange of the mobile phone’s microphone 208).\\nIn some embodiments, the communication may\\n[0037]\\ninclude a video communication. For example, the mobile\\nphone 200 may activate a camera 207 thereof such that\\na recipient of the call may receive video relating to the\\nuser of accessory’s circumstances (e.g., video and audio\\nwithin the range of the mobile device’s camera 207 and\\nmicrophone 208).\\nIn some embodiments, the communication may\\n[0038]\\ninclude a text message, an email, or any other electronic\\ncommunication.  Thereby,  the  communication  may  in-\\nclude, for example, a message conveying a request for\\nhelp and/or instructing the recipient to call police or other\\nemergency  services.  The  communication  may  also  in-\\nclude  location  data  regarding  a  position  of  the  mobile\\nphone 200. For example, the mobile phone 200 may fur-\\nther include a positioning system sensor 210 (e.g., GPS,\\nGLONASS, indoor positioning), which may determine a\\nlocation thereof, and such location information may be\\nincluded in the communication transmitted by the com-\\nmunication interface 206 of the mobile phone. In another\\nexample, the mobile accessory device 100 may further\\ninclude  a  position  location  detector  system  154  (e.g.,\\nGPS, GLONASS, indoor positioning), which may deter-\\nmine  a  location  thereof,  and  such  location  information\\nmay be included in the communication transmitted by the\\ncommunication  interface  134  of  the  mobile  accessory.\\nFor example, the recipients of the communication may\\nbe provided with an  image showing the position  of the\\nmobile  phone  200  and/or  a  link  to  a  map  showing  the\\nposition. Such a map may be updated with the positon\\nof the mobile phone 200 such that the position thereof\\nmay  be  tracked  in  the  event  that  movement  occurs.\\nThereby, emergency service personnel may be directed\\nto the location of the mobile phone 200.\\nIn another embodiment, communications may\\n[0039]\\nadditionally or alternatively be transmitted to other users\\nof mobile accessory devices in local proximity to the mo-\\nbile accessory device 100. For example, the communi-\\ncation interface 134 of the mobile accessory device 100\\nmay directly communicate with the communication inter-\\nface of other nearby mobile phone accessories to alert\\ntheir  users  of  a  nearby  user  in  need  of  assistance.  In\\nsome embodiments the mobile accessory devices 100\\nmay form a mesh network via the communication inter-\\nfaces 134 to expand the reach of the local alerts.\\n[0040] FIG. 9 schematically illustrates control circuitry\\ncomponents of the controller 112 (e.g., an alarm device)\\naccording to an embodiment of the present disclosure.\\n\\n\\x0c15 \\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n16 \\n\\nAs illustrated, the  control  circuitry of  the controller  112\\nmay  include  or  otherwise  be  in  communication  with  a\\nprocessor 136 and a memory device 138.\\n[0041] The  processor  136  may  be  embodied  in  a\\nnumber of different  forms. For example,  the processor\\n136 may be embodied as one or more of various process-\\ning means such as a coprocessor, a microprocessor, a\\ncontroller, a digital signal processor (DSP), processing\\ncircuitry,  or  various  other  processing devices  including\\nintegrated circuits such as, for example, a special-pur-\\npose computer chip, or other hardware processor. In an\\nexample embodiment, the processor 136 may be config-\\nured to execute instructions stored in the memory device\\n138 or  otherwise  accessible to the  processor. Alterna-\\ntively or additionally, the processor 136 may be config-\\nured to execute  hard coded  functionality. As such, the\\nprocessor 136 may be capable of performing operations\\naccording  to  embodiments  of  the  present  disclosure\\nwhile  configured  accordingly.  Alternatively,  when  the\\nprocessor 136 is embodied as an executor of software\\ninstructions,  the instructions may  specifically configure\\nthe processor to perform the operations described here-\\nin. The processor 136 may include a clock, an arithmetic\\nlogic  unit  (ALU)  and  logic  gates  configured  to  support\\noperation of the processor, amongst other components.\\n[0042] The memory device 138 may include non-tran-\\nsitory  and  tangible  memory  that  may  be,  for  example,\\nvolatile and/or non-volatile memory. The memory device\\n138 may be configured to store information, data, files,\\napplications,  instructions  or  the  like.  For  example,  the\\nmemory  device  138  can  be  configured  to  buffer  input\\ndata for processing by the processor 136. Additionally or\\nalternatively, the memory device 138 can be configured\\nto store instructions for execution by the processor 136.\\n[0043] The processor 136 may be configured to exe-\\ncute program code instructions stored on a non-transitory\\ncomputer readable medium. In this regard, an embodi-\\nment of a non-transitory computer readable medium for\\nstoring  computer instructions executed  by  a processor\\n(e.g., processor 136) is provided, such as the memory\\ndevice 138. The non-transitory computer readable me-\\ndium may comprise program code instructions for per-\\nforming the alarm operations described herein.\\n[0044] The various aspects, embodiments, implemen-\\ntations or features of the described embodiments can be\\nused separately or in any combination. Various aspects\\nof the described embodiments can be implemented by\\nsoftware,  hardware  or  a  combination  of  hardware  and\\nsoftware. The described embodiments can also be em-\\nbodied as computer readable code on a computer read-\\nable medium for controlling the above-described opera-\\ntions. In particular, computer readable code may be con-\\nfigured to perform each of the operations of the methods\\ndescribed  herein and embodied as computer  readable\\ncode on a computer readable medium for controlling the\\nabove-described operations. In this regard, a computer\\nreadable  storage  medium,  as  used  herein,  refers  to  a\\nnon-transitory, physical storage medium (e.g., a volatile\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n35\\n\\n40\\n\\n45\\n\\n50\\n\\n55\\n\\n9\\n\\nor non-volatile memory device, which can be read by a\\ncomputer system.  Examples of the  computer readable\\nmedium  include  read-only  memory,  random-access\\nmemory, CD-ROMs, DVDs, magnetic tape, and optical\\ndata  storage devices. The computer  readable  medium\\ncan also be distributed over network-coupled computer\\nsystems  so  that  the  computer  readable  code  is  stored\\nand executed in a distributed fashion.\\n[0045] Although the present disclosure is generally de-\\nscribed as relating to a mobile accessory, in another em-\\nbodiment some or all of the components of the mobile\\naccessory described above may be included in a stan-\\ndalone personal safety device (see, e.g., FIG. 23). In oth-\\ner words, a personal safety device may be configured for\\nuse  without  requiring a  separate mobile phone.  In  this\\nregard, the personal safety device may be configured to\\ncommunicate  with  cellular  networks  and  configured  to\\ndetermine a location of the personal safety device. Thus,\\nfor example, the communication interface may be con-\\nfigured to communicate with cellular or satellite networks\\nin order to allow for transmission of electronic communi-\\ncations  and  the  personal safety  device  may further in-\\nclude a GPS sensor configured to determine the location\\nof the personal safety device.\\n[0046] As noted above, the form factor of the mobile\\naccessory device 100 may vary. In this regard, FIG. 10\\nillustrates an embodiment of the mobile accessory device\\n100A including the switch 128 of FIG. 8. FIG. 11 illustrates\\nan embodiment of the mobile accessory device 100B pro-\\nvided in the form of a case. FIG. 12 illustrates an embod-\\niment of the mobile accessory device 100C wherein the\\nmobile accessory is substantially rectangular with round-\\ned corners. FIG. 13 illustrates an embodiment of the mo-\\nbile accessory device 100D wherein the mobile acces-\\nsory is round. FIG. 14 illustrates an embodiment of the\\nmobile accessory device 100E wherein the user separa-\\ntion  sensor  arrangement  includes  a  wireless  wearable\\ncomponent 120D. FIGS. 15-18 illustrate an embodiment\\nof the mobile accessory device 100F wherein the mobile\\naccessory is ovular. FIG. 19 illustrates an embodiment\\nof the mobile accessory device 100G wherein the wear-\\nable component of the user separation sensor arrange-\\nment  is  not  attached  for  illustration  purposes.  FIG.  20\\nillustrates an embodiment of the mobile accessory device\\n100H wherein a mobile phone is not attached for illustra-\\ntion purposes. FIG. 21 illustrates an embodiment of the\\nmobile  accessory  device  1001  wherein  the  mobile  ac-\\ncessory is attached to a case 208 for the mobile phone\\n200.\\nIn examples such as the mobile accessory de-\\n[0047]\\nvice 100E and the wearable component 120D of FIG. 14,\\nthe connection between the wearable component 120D\\nand the mobile accessory device 100E may be wireless.\\nFor example, the connection may be a radio frequency\\nconnection (e.g., BLUETOOTH connection), a photonic\\nconnection (e.g., infrared beacon, IrDA), sonic (e.g., ul-\\ntrasonic beacon), or magnetic (e.g., a Hall sensor in the\\nmobile accessory device activated when a magnet in the\\n\\n\\x0c17 \\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n18 \\n\\nwearable component or the mobile phone is moved too\\nfar away).\\nIn some embodiments, the user separation sen-\\n[0048]\\nsor arrangement 118 can be configured to measure or\\notherwise detect a strength of a wireless signal provided\\nby the wearable component. The strength of the signal\\ncan  be  proportional  or  otherwise  representative  of  the\\ndistance between the wearable component and the user\\nseparation sensor arrangement 118 (e.g., the larger the\\nseparation distance, the weaker the received signal will\\nbe). The user separation sensor arrangement 118 can\\ncompare the strength of the received signal to a prede-\\ntermined threshold signal strength value. If the received\\nsignal strength is determined to be less than the threshold\\nsignal  strength  value,  the  user  separation  sensor  ar-\\nrangement  118  can  provide  an  activation  signal to the\\ncontroller 112. In some embodiments, the user separa-\\ntion sensor arrangement 118 may be configured to detect\\nthe presence and/or absence of a beacon signal, and the\\nthreshold signal strength value can be a timeout value.\\nFor example, the wearable component 120D can be con-\\nfigured to emit a beacon signal once every second, and\\nthe threshold signal strength value can be set to five sec-\\nonds.  In  this  example,  the  user  separation  sensor  ar-\\nrangement 118 can determine that no beacon signal has\\nbeen received for at least five seconds, and respond by\\ndetermining  that  the  wearable  component  120D  is  no\\nlonger in proximity (and/or physically attached) to the mo-\\nbile  accessory  device  100E  and  provide  an  activation\\nsignal to the controller 112.\\n[0049] FIGs. 22A-F illustrate steps associated with us-\\nage of a wearable component 120I (e.g., a wrist strap)\\nof the mobile accessory device 1001 of FIG. 21. FIG. 22A\\nshows a mobile phone 200 having an attached (e.g., ad-\\nhesively, with tabs/slots, or hooks and loops) mobile ac-\\ncessory  device  1001.  The  microphone  of  the  mobile\\nphone 200 is shown at 208. The mobile accessory device\\n1001 includes a groove 209 defined in the surface of the\\nmobile  accessory  device  1001,  sized  to accommodate\\nstorage of the wearable component 1201. FIGs. 22B-D\\nshow  a  user  in  the  process  of  removing  the  wearable\\ncomponent 1201 from the groove 209 so that he or she\\ncan engage the wearable component 1201 into a worn\\nposition, such as shown in FIG. 22E (e.g., donned upon\\na wrist). FIG. 22F illustrates how the user might hold mo-\\nbile  phone  200  after he or she has removed wearable\\ncomponent 1201 form the groove 209 and put it around\\nhis or her wrist. The user can later remove (e.g., doff) the\\nwearable component 1201 and stow it in the groove 209.\\n[0050] FIG. 23 illustrates an embodiment of a personal\\nsafety device 300 that does not require usage of a sep-\\narate mobile phone, but rather is implemented as a stan-\\ndalone, dedicated personal  safety device. Such a  per-\\nsonal safety device 300 may have sufficient components\\nand functionalities to perform the operation\\n[0051] Further, FIGS. 24-26 illustrate an embodiment\\nof the mobile accessory device 100J according to an ad-\\nditional example embodiment of the present disclosure.\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n35\\n\\n40\\n\\n45\\n\\n50\\n\\n55\\n\\n10\\n\\nThe mobile accessory device 100J is illustrated as being\\nattached to the mobile phone 200 as discussed above.\\nThe overall configuration and features of the mobile ac-\\ncessory device 100J may be substantially similar to that\\nof the mobile accessory device 100 of FIG. 1. However,\\nthe mobile accessory device 100J of FIGS. 24-26 may\\nvary in one or more respects.\\n[0052] For example, as illustrated, the position of the\\ncomponents of the mobile accessory device 100J relative\\nto  the  housing  102J  may vary. In  this  regard,  the  light\\noutput device 116J may be positioned at a top center of\\nthe outer surface 106J of the housing 102J. This config-\\nuration may allow the light output device 116J to be ex-\\nposed and visible above the top of the user’s hand in the\\nevent of activation while in the user’s hand, such that it\\nis more noticeable. The audio output device 114J may\\nbe  positioned  in  a  similar  location  as  compared  to  the\\naudio output device 114 of the mobile accessory device\\n100 of FIG. 1, but the housing 102J may include a pattern\\nof round holes defined there through that allow sounds\\nto  exit  the  mobile  accessory  device  100J.  Further,  the\\nswitch  128J  may  be  substantially  similar  to  the  switch\\n128A  described  above  with  respect  to  FIG.  8,  but  the\\nends  thereof  may  be  relatively  more  rounded  for  im-\\nproved ergonomics and/or appearance. Additionally, the\\nbattery portion may be positioned at the attachment sur-\\nface of the mobile accessory device 100J engaged with\\nthe mobile phone 200 in order to de-clutter the exposed\\nouter surfaces thereof.\\n[0053] Further, the mobile accessory device 100J may\\ninclude a nail slot 140J, which may be positioned between\\nthe connector 126J and the housing 102J. In this regard,\\nin  some  embodiments  the  user  separation  sensor  ar-\\nrangement may be activated by engaging a fingernail in\\nthe nail slot 140J and releasing the connector 126 rather\\nthan requiring the user to release the wearable compo-\\nnent 120J first. Thereby, activation of the user separation\\nsensor arrangement may be conducted quickly (e.g., in\\nan unexpected dangerous situation), if necessary.\\n[0054] Further, the particular configuration of the wear-\\nable component 120J may differ. In this regard, as illus-\\ntrated in FIGS. 24-26, in an un-extended configuration,\\nthe lanyard 124J may wrap around a lower comer of the\\nhousing 102J and extend to and wrap around a top comer\\nof the housing. The wearable component 120J may then\\nextend downward from the lanyard 124J to the bottom\\nedge of the housing 102J. A clip 142J may be positioned\\nat the interface between the lanyard 124J and the wear-\\nable  component  120J.  In  some  embodiments,  the  clip\\n142J may be moveable such that the relative length of\\nthe  wearable  component  120J  relative  to  the  lanyard\\n124J is adjustable  and thereby  a  user may tighten the\\nwearable component around his or her wrist during use.\\nThe clip 142J may be configured to engage the housing\\n102J when in an un-extended configuration to retain the\\nlanyard 124J in place.\\n[0055] Further, the wearable component 120J may in-\\nclude a pull tab 144J at an end thereof. The pull tab 144J\\n\\n\\x0c19 \\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n20 \\n\\nmay retain the wearable component 120J in the un-ex-\\ntended configuration until the user releases the pull tab\\nfrom engagement with the housing 102J. Releasing the\\npull  tab  144J  from engagement with  the housing 102J\\nmay activate one or more features. For example, in re-\\nsponse to the pull tab 144J being released, the position-\\ning system sensor 210 (see, FIG. 7) may be instructed\\nto  activate  via  the  communication  mechanisms  de-\\nscribed  above.  Accordingly,  when  a  user  extends  the\\nwearable  component  120J  and  places  it  on  his  or  her\\nwrist, for example when confronted with a dangerous sit-\\nuation or location, the user’s location may be determined\\nand tracked at that time. Thereby, in the event that the\\nuser pulls out the connector 126J, the positioning system\\nsensor 210 will have already been activated in order to\\nsubstantially immediately provide the user’s location as\\ndescribed above. Thereby, for example, any delays as-\\nsociated  with  determining  the  user’s  location  may  be\\navoided. Further, the user’s location may be tracked dur-\\ning the time period during which the pull tab 144J is re-\\nleased and thereby the user’s location information may\\noptionally be shared with one or more persons, if desired.\\n[0056] The  embodiment of the mobile accessory de-\\nvice 100K illustrated in FIGS. 27 and 28 is substantially\\nsimilar to the mobile accessory of FIGS. 24-26 in most\\nrespects and hence the configuration thereof will not be\\nrepeated. However, the nail slot 140K is enlarged.\\n[0057] FIGs. 29-35 illustrate various views of another\\nexample mobile accessory device 1001 according to an\\nadditional  example  embodiment  of  the  present  disclo-\\nsure. The mobile accessory device 100L is configured to\\nbe attached to the mobile phone 200 as will be discussed\\nfurther below. The overall configuration and features of\\nthe mobile accessory device 100L may be substantially\\nsimilar to that of the mobile accessory device 100 of FIG.\\n1. However, the mobile accessory device 100L of FIGS.\\n29-35 may vary in one or more respects.\\n[0058] For example, as illustrated, the position of the\\ncomponents of the mobile accessory device 100L relative\\nto the housing 102L may vary. The audio output device\\n114L may be positioned in a similar location as compared\\nto the audio output device 114 of the mobile accessory\\ndevice 100 of FIG. 1, but the housing 102L may include\\na round hole defined there through that allow sounds to\\nexit the mobile accessory device 100L.\\n[0059] Further, the particular configuration of the wear-\\nable component 120L may differ. In this regard, as illus-\\ntrated in FIGS. 29-35, in an un-extended configuration,\\nwearable component 120L and the lanyard 124L may be\\nstow-able in a groove 2909 formed about the periphery\\nof the housing 102L. Further, the wearable component\\n120L may include a pull tab 144L at an end thereof. The\\npull tab 144L may retain the wearable component 120L\\nin the stowed (e.g., un-extended) configuration until the\\nuser releases the pull  tab 144L from engagement with\\nthe housing 102L. Releasing the pull tab 144L from en-\\ngagement  with  the  housing  102L  may  activate  one  or\\nmore features. For example, in response to the pull tab\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n35\\n\\n40\\n\\n45\\n\\n50\\n\\n55\\n\\n11\\n\\n144L being released, the positioning system sensor 210\\n(see, FIG. 7) may be instructed to activate via the com-\\nmunication mechanisms described above. Accordingly,\\nwhen  a  user  removes  the  wearable  component  120L\\nfrom the groove 2909 and places it on his or her wrist,\\nfor example when confronted with a dangerous situation\\nor location, the user’s location may be determined and\\ntracked at that time. Thereby, in the event that the user\\npulls out the connector 126L, the positioning system sen-\\nsor 210 will have already been activated in order to sub-\\nstantially immediately provide the user’s location as de-\\nscribed above. Thereby, for example, any delays asso-\\nciated with determining the user’s location may be avoid-\\ned.  Further,  the  user’s  location  may  be  tracked  during\\nthe time period during which the pull tab 144L is released\\nand thereby the user’s location information may option-\\nally be shared with one or more persons, if desired.\\n[0060] Further, the switch 128L may be a pressure sen-\\nsitive  or  membrane  switch  defined  as  a  fingertip-sized\\nrecess having a textured pattern (e.g., to ease identifica-\\ntion  and  location  of  the  switch  128L  by  either  sight  or\\ntouch).  In  use,  the  switch  may  be  used  to  activate  an\\nalarm  though  a  predetermined  continuous  press  (e.g.,\\nthree  seconds)  or  through  a  predetermined  series  of\\npresses (e.g., three presses within five seconds), for ex-\\nample, to reduce the occurrence of accidental activation.\\nIn some implementations, the switch 128L may activate\\na different type of alarm than may be triggered by sepa-\\nration of the lanyard. For example, the mobile accessory\\ndevice 100L may respond to activation of the switch 128L\\nby initiating a silent alarm to alert one or more predeter-\\nmined recipients (e.g., discretely sending a message to\\na preselected contact), while the mobile accessory de-\\nvice 100L may respond to separation of the connector\\n126L by initiating an audible alarm  and alerting one or\\nmore predetermined recipients (e.g., set off a siren and\\nsend a message or place a phone call to police).\\n[0061] Further, the mobile accessory device 100L may\\ninclude a nail slot positioned between the connector 126L\\nand the housing 102L. In this regard, in some embodi-\\nments the user separation sensor arrangement may be\\nactivated  by  engaging  a  fingernail  in  the  nail  slot  and\\nreleasing  the  connector  126L  rather than  requiring  the\\nuser  to  release  the  wearable  component  120L  first.\\nThereby,  activation  of  the  user  separation  sensor  ar-\\nrangement may be conducted quickly (e.g., in an unex-\\npected dangerous situation), if necessary.\\n[0062] The  mobile  accessory  device  100L  also  in-\\ncludes a visual indicator 2902 (e.g.,  a  light, a  display).\\nThe visual indicator 2902 is configured to provide a visible\\nindication of one or more statuses of the mobile acces-\\nsory device. For example, the visual indicator 2902 may\\nblink at a first rate or pattern (e.g., or illuminate steadily),\\nilluminate at a  first  brightness,  and/or  illuminate  with  a\\nfirst color to display a first condition (e.g., to indicate that\\nthe  mobile  accessory  device  100L  is  connected  to  or\\npaired with the mobile phone 200 and/or an associated\\nalarm software application  running on  the phone), and\\n\\n\\x0c21 \\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n22 \\n\\nblink,  illuminate,  and/or  colorize  in  different  predeter-\\nmined manners to display other conditions (e.g., to indi-\\ncate that the mobile accessory device 100L is not paired\\nor  otherwise  communicatively  associated  with  mobile\\nphone 200, to indicate that the mobile accessory device\\n100L is not able to communicate with the mobile phone\\n200 to which it was previously paired or otherwise com-\\nmunicatively associated). In some embodiments, the vis-\\nual indicator 2902 may display differently shaped prede-\\ntermined patterns to indicate different conditions of the\\nmobile accessory device 100L. For example, the visual\\nindicator 2902 may appear as a periodically blinking, blue\\nBLUETOOTH symbol to indicate that the mobile acces-\\nsory device 100L is ready for pairing, and may appear\\nas a red \"X\" when the mobile accessory device 100L is\\nnot able to communicate with the paired mobile phone\\n200 or an associated software application installed there-\\nupon  and  configured  to  respond  to  alarm  signals  from\\nthe mobile accessory device 100L.\\n[0063] Referring  now  to  FIG.  35,  a  rear  perspective\\nview of the mobile accessory device 100L is shown. The\\nrear side of the housing 102L includes an adhesive pad\\n3502. In use, the adhesive pad 3502 can be contacted\\nagainst a surface of the mobile phone 200 (e.g., the rear\\nsurface 202).\\n[0064] FIG. 36 is a flow chart of an example process\\n3600 for using an example mobile accessory device. In\\nsome  implementations,  the  process  3600  can  be  per-\\nformed using one or more of the example mobile device\\naccessories 100A-100L of  FIGs. 1-23, and 25-35,  and\\nthe personal safety device 300 of FIG. 23.\\n[0065] At 3610, an attachment surface of a housing of\\na mobile accessory device is engaged to a mobile device.\\nFor example, the attachment surface 104 of the housing\\n102 may be configured to engage the rear surface 202\\nof the mobile phone 200. In another example, the adhe-\\nsive pad 3502 shown in FIG. 35 can be used to secure\\nthe  mobile  accessory  device  100L  to  a  mobile  device,\\nsuch as to the rear surface 202 of the mobile phone 200.\\n[0066] At 3620, a wearable component is donned upon\\na user of the mobile device. For example, the wearable\\ncomponent 120 of FIG. 5, the wireless wearable compo-\\nnent 120D of FIG. 14, and/or the wearable component\\n1201 of FIGs 22A-F can be worn about a user’s wrist. In\\nother  examples,  the  wearable  component  can  donned\\nupon or otherwise carried by a user (e.g., a pendant, a\\nring, an earring, an earpiece, bracelet, wristwatch, eye-\\nglass frame, hair clip), the user’s clothing (e.g., a remote\\nunit carried in the user’s pocket, a pin, a badge, clipped\\nto a belt, a belt buckle, head band, hat), and/or the user’s\\npersonal effects (e.g., a remote unit carried in purse or\\nbag, a key fob, an identification card).\\n[0067] At  3630,  a  separation sensor  detects  that the\\nwearable  component  has  separated from  the  housing.\\nFor example, the user input sensor 122 can determine\\nthat  the  wearable  component  120  has  exceeded  a\\nthreshold  separation  distance  from  the  controller  112\\nand/or  that  the  wearable  component  120  has  become\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n35\\n\\n40\\n\\n45\\n\\n50\\n\\n55\\n\\n12\\n\\nphysically  detached  from  the  mobile  accessory  device\\n100.\\nIn some embodiments,  the process  3600  can\\n[0068]\\ninclude detecting a mechanical separation of the housing\\nand  a  lanyard  affixed  to  the  wearable  component,  the\\nlanyard having a predetermined length and mechanically\\nconnecting the wearable component to the housing, the\\nlanyard being mechanically separable from the housing\\nwhen  distance  between  the  wearable  component  and\\nthe housing exceeds the predetermined length. For ex-\\nample, the user input sensor 122 can determine that the\\nwearable component 120 has become detached, disen-\\ngaged, or otherwise physically separated from the con-\\ntroller 112.\\nIn some embodiments, detecting that the wear-\\n[0069]\\nable component has separated from the housing can in-\\nclude determining a signal strength of a wireless tether\\nsignal transmitted by a wireless transmitter of the wear-\\nable  component to  a wireless  receiver arranged within\\nthe housing  and  in  communication with the  separation\\nsensor, the signal strength being representative of a dis-\\ntance between the wearable component and the housing,\\nand determining that the signal strength is less than or\\nequal to a predetermined signal strength defining a pre-\\ndetermined separation distance. For example, the user\\nseparation sensor arrangement 118 can determine that\\nthe wearable component 120D has exceeded a threshold\\nseparation distance from the controller 112, or that a pe-\\nriodic  beacon  transmitted  by  the  wearable  component\\n120D has not been received for a predetermined length\\nof time.\\n[0070] At 3640, an alarm device is activated based on\\ndetecting  that  the  wearable  component  has  separated\\nfrom the housing. For example, the controller 112 of FIG.\\n7 can be activated. In some embodiments, activating the\\nalarm  device  can  include  transmitting  an  alarm  signal;\\nand wherein the process 3600 can also include receiving,\\nby mobile device, the alarm signal, and sending, by the\\nmobile device and in response to the receiving the alarm\\nsignal, a predetermined communication to one or more\\npredefined recipients. For example, the controller 112 of\\nFIG. 7 can activate the communication interface 134 to\\ncommunicate  with  the  mobile  phone  200.  The  mobile\\nphone 200 may have a software application installed and\\nexecuting thereupon,  and  the software application  can\\nbe  configured  to  react  to  the  communication  from  the\\nmobile accessory device 100E to cause the mobile phone\\nto communicate with one or more predetermined recipi-\\nents. For example, the software application may be con-\\nfigured to initiate a call, send a text message, email, me-\\ndia  file,  media  stream,  location  information  (e.g.,  GPS\\ndata), captured audio and/or video, or any other appro-\\npriate  information  to  one  or  more  contacts  previously\\nidentified by the user (e.g., family member, friend, neigh-\\nbor, doctor, nurse, caregiver, welfare official, emergency\\nservices, 911)\\nIn some embodiments, activating the alarm de-\\n[0071]\\nvice can include activating an audio output component\\n\\n\\x0c23 \\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n24 \\n\\ndisposed within the housing  and configured to emit an\\naudible alert when activated. For example, the controller\\n112 includes the audio output device 114 that can emit\\na siren, noise, prerecorded or synthesized spoken words\\nor other sounds, or any other appropriate sound that is\\nsufficiently loud enough to attract the attention of other\\nnearby persons and/or  repel an attacker.  In some em-\\nbodiments, activating the alarm device can include acti-\\nvating a visual output configured to emit an audible alert\\nwhen activated. For example, the controller 112 includes\\nthe light output device 116 that can emit a light or strobe\\nto  attract  the  attention  of  other  nearby  persons  and/or\\nrepel an attacker.\\nIn  some  embodiments, the  process 3600 can\\n[0072]\\ninclude removing the wearable component from a cavity\\ndefined  by  the  housing,  wherein  the  cavity  is  sized  to\\naccommodate storage of the wearable component. For\\nexample, FIGs. 22A-22F show that the example weara-\\nble component 1201 can be at least partly removed from\\nthe  mobile  accessory  device  1001  before  being  worn\\nabout the wrist of the user. In some embodiments, the\\nprocess 3600 can also include doffing the wearable com-\\nponent from the user, and stowing the wearable compo-\\nnent in a cavity defined by the housing, wherein the cavity\\nis sized to accommodate storage of the wearable com-\\nponent.  For  example,  the  process  illustrated  by  FIGs.\\n22A-22F can be reversed such that the user can take the\\nwearable component 1201 or 120L off his or her wrist,\\nand placed back in the groove 209 or 2909 defined in the\\nhousing of the mobile accessory device 1001 or 100L.\\n[0073] FIGs. 37a-45 illustrate various views of another\\nexample mobile accessory device 100M according to an\\nadditional  example  embodiment  of  the  present  disclo-\\nsure. The mobile accessory device 100M is configured\\nto be attached to the mobile phone 200, either directly or\\nindirectly, as will be discussed further below. The overall\\nconfiguration and features of the mobile accessory de-\\nvice 100M may be substantially similar to, or a subset of,\\nthat of the mobile accessory device 100 of FIG. 1. How-\\never, the mobile accessory device 100M of FIGS. 37a-\\n45 may vary in one or more respects.\\n[0074] The mobile accessory device 100M includes a\\nuser  input  sensor  having a  movable  component  144M\\n(e.g., a pull tab), which serves as a user input mechanism,\\nand is configured to activate when the movable compo-\\nnent 144M is at least partially moved, and an alarm device\\n(not shown) disposed in the housing 102M and config-\\nured to activate in response to activation of the user input\\nsensor. Activation of the alarm device can cause an au-\\ndible alarm, or cause a software application to be exe-\\ncuted  on  the  mobile  phone  200,  or  both.  The  audible\\nalarm can come either from an optional audio emitting\\ndevice disposed in the mobile accessory device 100M or\\n(e.g., in embodiments where the mobile accessory de-\\nvice  100M  does  not  include  an  audio  emitting  device)\\nfrom the mobile phone 200, e.g., using a speaker built\\ninto the mobile phone 200.\\n[0075] For example, as illustrated, the position of the\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n35\\n\\n40\\n\\n45\\n\\n50\\n\\n55\\n\\n13\\n\\ncomponents of the mobile accessory device 100M rela-\\ntive to a housing 102M may vary. A pull tab 144M is con-\\nfigured to remain in a stowed (e.g., un-extended) config-\\nuration  until  the  user  releases  the  pull  tab  144M  from\\nengagement with  the  housing 102M  or  moves  the  pull\\ntab 144M relative to the housing 102M. Releasing or mov-\\ning the pull tab 144M may activate one or more features.\\nFor  example,  in  response  to  the  pull  tab  144M  being\\nmoved, removed (at least in part), shifted, or released,\\nthe positioning system sensor 210 (see, FIG. 7) may be\\ninstructed  to  activate  via  the  communication  mecha-\\nnisms described above. Further, the user’s location may\\nbe  tracked,  e.g.,  using  GPS-like  functionality  built  into\\nthe mobile  phone 200, during  the time period  in which\\nthe pull tab 144M is released and thereby the user’s lo-\\ncation information may optionally be shared with one or\\nmore persons, if desired, e.g., using the communications\\ncapabilities of the mobile phone 200 (e.g., phone, email,\\nSMS text).\\n[0076] Further,  the  mobile  accessory  device  100M\\nmay include a slot 126M or a feature providing equivalent\\nfunctionality, positioned between the pull tab 144M and\\nthe housing 102M. In this regard, in some embodiments\\nthe user separation sensor arrangement may be activat-\\ned, for example, by engaging a fingernail or equivalent\\nin the slot 126M and moving the pull tab 144M. Thereby,\\nbased  on  user  input,  activation  of  the  user  separation\\nsensor arrangement may be conducted quickly (e.g., in\\nan unexpected dangerous situation), if necessary, for ex-\\nample, by moving (at least in part) the pull tab 144M.\\nIn  some  embodiments,  the  slot  126M,  which\\n[0077]\\nserves as a user input mechanism, may be supplement-\\ned or substituted with one or more other mechanical fea-\\ntures  configured  to  provide  frictional,  grippable,  or\\ngraspable surface or element to ease releasing or moving\\nthe pull tab 144M. Examples of such mechanical features\\ncan  include  raised  or  recessed  ribs,  dimples,  latches,\\nloops,  hooks,  projections,  textures  (e.g.,  rough,  soft,\\nsticky), or combinations of these or other mechanical fea-\\ntures  that  can  promote  manual  operation  (e.g.,  move-\\nment or removal) of the pull tab 144M.\\n[0078] Alternatively,  or  in  addition,  other  use  input\\nmechanisms (e.g., switches or buttons) may be used as\\na user input mechanism to trigger actuation of the mobile\\naccessory  device  100M.  In  one  such  embodiment,  a\\nswitch 128M (e.g., a button) is arranged on a lateral side\\n3710a of the housing 102M, substantially perpendicular\\nto  a  major  face  surface  3712.  Another  switch  129M  is\\narranged on a lateral side 3710b of the housing 102M,\\nsubstantially  perpendicular  to  the  major  face  surface\\n3712 opposite the switch 129M. The switch 128M and/or\\nthe switch 129M may be a depressible button, pressure\\nsensitive, or membrane switches defined as a fingertip-\\nsized recess or protrusion having a textured pattern (e.g.,\\nto  facilitate  identification  and  location  of  the  switch  by\\neither sight or touch). In use, the switch 128M and the\\nswitch 129M  are pressed  substantially simultaneously.\\nFor example, in the illustrated configuration, a user can\\n\\n\\x0c25 \\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n26 \\n\\nsqueeze the switch 128M and the switch 129M with two\\ndifferent fingers of one hand in order to activate an alarm,\\nthereby reducing a likelihood of false alarms due to ac-\\ncidental actuation of a single button. The switches may\\nbe  used  to  activate  an  alarm  though  a  predetermined\\ncontinuous press (e.g., three seconds), through a prede-\\ntermined series of presses (e.g., three presses within five\\nseconds),  or through  a  particular sequence  of presses\\n(e.g., first pressing the switch 128M and then the switch\\n129M), for  example, to reduce  the occurrence of acci-\\ndental activation.\\nIn  some  implementations,  the  switches  128M\\n[0079]\\nand  129M  may  activate  a  different  type  of  action  than\\nmay be triggered by separation of the pull tab 144M. For\\nexample,  the  mobile  accessory  device  100M  may  re-\\nspond to activation of the switches 128M and 129M by\\ninitiating a silent alarm to alert one or more predetermined\\nrecipients  (e.g.,  causing  the  mobile  phone  200  to  dis-\\ncretely send a message to a preselected contact), while\\nthe  mobile  accessory  device  100M  may  respond  to\\nmovement or partial removal of the pull tab 144M by in-\\nitiating an audible alarm and alerting one or more prede-\\ntermined recipients (e.g., set off a siren and send a mes-\\nsage or place a phone call to police). The audible alarm\\ncan come either from an optional audio emitting device\\ndisposed in the mobile accessory device 100M or (e.g.,\\nin  embodiments  where  the  mobile  accessory  device\\n100M does not  include  an  audio emitting  device)  from\\nthe mobile phone 200, e.g., using a speaker built into the\\nmobile phone 200.\\nIn some embodiments, the movable component\\n[0080]\\n(e.g.,  pull  tab  144M)  can  be  configured  to  be  at  least\\npartly moved relative to the housing 102M when subject-\\ned to a predetermined force. In some embodiments, the\\nmobile accessory device 100M can include a wearable\\ncomponent having a lanyard (e.g., the example wearable\\ncomponent 120) configured to mechanically attach to the\\nhousing 102M and/or the pull tab 144M and provide at\\nleast the predetermined force to the movable component\\nbased on a pull of upon the lanyard and at least partly\\nmove  the  movable  component  relative  to  the  housing\\n102M based on the pull.\\n[0081] FIG.  37b  shows  the  mobile  accessory  device\\n100M adhered or affixed to a companion mobile acces-\\nsory device 3701 (e.g., a wallet for holding identification\\ncards, credit cards, cash, or the like) which in turn is ad-\\nhered or affixed to the mobile phone 200. However, the\\nmobile accessory device 100M can be adhered or affixed\\ndirectly to the mobile phone 200 without the need for, or\\nuse of, the companion mobile accessory device 3701.\\n[0082] FIGs. 38-39 show the mobile accessory device\\n100M attached to the companion mobile accessory de-\\nvice 3701 without the mobile phone 200, whereas FIG.\\n40 shows the companion mobile accessory device 3701\\nalone.\\n[0083] FIGs. 41-43 show the mobile accessory device\\n100M  separate  from  the  companion  mobile  accessory\\ndevice  3701.  In some implementations, the  mobile ac-\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n35\\n\\n40\\n\\n45\\n\\n50\\n\\n55\\n\\n14\\n\\ncessory device 100M can engage (e.g., adhere to) a por-\\ntion of the mobile phone 200. In some implementations,\\nthe mobile accessory device 100M can engage a portion\\nof  a  companion  mobile  accessory  device  3701  (which\\nwill  be  discussed  further  in  the  description  of  FIGs.\\n44-45). In some embodiments, the mobile accessory de-\\nvice 100M and the companion mobile accessory device\\n3701 may be configured as two physically independent\\ncomponents that may be adhered or otherwise mechan-\\nically engaged to each other or may be used independ-\\nently. In some embodiments, the mobile accessory de-\\nvice 100M and the companion mobile accessory device\\n3701 may be configured as a combined unit (e.g., formed\\nas a monolithic, unitary assembly having a shared hous-\\ning).\\n[0084] Referring  now  to  FIG.  43,  a  rear  perspective\\nview of the mobile accessory device 100M is shown. A\\nmajor  face  4302  of  the  rear  side  of  the  housing  102M\\nincludes an adhesive pad 4301. In use, the adhesive pad\\n4301 can be contacted against (e.g., adhered to) a sur-\\nface of the mobile phone 200 (e.g., the rear surface 202),\\nor the surface 3702 of the companion mobile accessory\\ndevice 3701, or any other appropriate surface.\\n[0085] Referring now to FIGs. 40 and 45, rear perspec-\\ntive  views  of  the  companion  mobile  accessory  device\\n3701 is shown. A rear side 3703 of the companion mobile\\naccessory device 3701 includes an adhesive pad 4001.\\nIn use, the adhesive pad 4001 can be contacted against\\na surface of the mobile phone 200 (e.g., the rear surface\\n202), or any other appropriate surface.\\n[0086] Referring now primarily to FIGs. 36-40, 44, and\\n45,  the  companion  mobile  accessory  device  3701  is\\nshown. The companion mobile accessory device 3701\\nhas a housing that defines a cavity 4002. The cavity 4002\\nis  configured  to  removably  retain  one  or  more  wallet-\\nsized  cards  3704,  such  as  credit  cards,  identification\\ncards (e.g., driver’s license), loyalty cards, security ac-\\ncess cards, folded cash, or any other appropriately sized\\nitems.\\n[0087] FIG. 46 is a flow chart of an example process\\nfor using an example mobile accessory device. In some\\nimplementations,  the  process  4600  can  be  performed\\nusing one or more of the example mobile device acces-\\nsories 100A-100L of FIGs. 1-23, and 25-35, the personal\\nsafety device 300 of FIG. 23, and the mobile accessory\\ndevice 100M of FIGs. 37a-43.\\n[0088] At 4610, an attachment surface of a housing of\\na mobile accessory device is engaged to a mobile device.\\nFor example, the major face 4302 of the housing 102M\\nmay be configured to engage the rear surface 202 of the\\nmobile phone 200. In another example, the adhesive pad\\n4301 shown in FIG. 43 can be used to secure (e.g., ad-\\nhere) the mobile accessory device 100M to the compan-\\nion mobile accessory device 3701.\\n[0089] At 4620, a user input is received. For example,\\none or a combination of the switches 128M, 129M may\\nhave been pressed by a user. In another example, the\\npull tab 144M may have been actuated or partly removed\\n\\n\\x0c27 \\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n28 \\n\\nby a user.\\n[0090] At  4630,  a  separation  sensor  detects  that,\\nbased on the received user input, the mobile accessory\\ndevice 100M has been actuated. For example, the user\\ninput sensor 122 can determine that the pull tab 144M\\nhas been moved, removed (at least partially), released\\nor shifted, or that the switch 128M and/or the button 129M\\nhas been pressed.\\nIn  some  embodiments, the  process 4600 can\\n[0091]\\ninclude detecting a mechanical separation of the housing\\nand a lanyard affixed to a wearable component, the lan-\\nyard  having  a  predetermined  length  and  mechanically\\nconnecting the wearable component to the housing, the\\nlanyard being mechanically separable from the housing\\nwhen  distance  between  the  wearable  component  and\\nthe housing exceeds the predetermined length. For ex-\\nample, the pull tab 144M can be connected to the wear-\\nable component 120, and the user input sensor 122 can\\ndetermine that the wearable component 120 has caused\\nthe pull tab 144M to move or at be at least partly removed\\nfrom the housing 102M.\\n[0092] At 4640, an alarm device is activated based on\\ndetecting that the user input has been actuated. For ex-\\nample, the controller 112 of FIG. 7 can be activated. In\\nsome embodiments, activating the alarm device can in-\\nclude transmitting an alarm signal; and wherein the proc-\\ness 4600 can also include receiving, by mobile device,\\nthe alarm signal, and sending, by the mobile device and\\nin response to the receiving the alarm signal, a predeter-\\nmined communication to one or more predefined recipi-\\nents. For example, the controller 112 of FIG. 7 can acti-\\nvate the  communication interface 134 to  communicate\\nwith the mobile phone 200. The mobile phone 200 may\\nhave  a  software  application  installed  and  executing\\nthereupon, and the software application can be config-\\nured to react to the communication from the mobile ac-\\ncessory device 100M to cause the mobile phone to com-\\nmunicate  with  one  or  more  predetermined  recipients,\\nand/or to emit an audible alarm or other sound. For ex-\\nample, the software application may be configured to in-\\nitiate a call, send a text message, email, media file, media\\nstream, location information (e.g., GPS data), captured\\naudio and/or video, or any other appropriate information\\nto one or more contacts previously identified by the user\\n(e.g., family member, friend, neighbor, doctor, nurse, car-\\negiver,  welfare  official,  emergency  services,  911).  In\\nsome embodiments, the alarm device can be any appro-\\npriate circuit and/or mechanism that is configured for tak-\\ning a predetermined action in response to a trigger, and\\ndoes not necessarily require nor preclude that the alarm\\ndevice is itself capable of generating an audible alarm.\\nIn some embodiments, activating the alarm de-\\n[0093]\\nvice can include activating an audio output component\\ndisposed within the housing  and configured to emit an\\naudible  alert  when  activated.  For  example,  the  mobile\\naccessory device 100M can include the audio output de-\\nvice 114 that can emit a siren, noise, prerecorded or syn-\\nthesized spoken words or other sounds, or any other ap-\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n35\\n\\n40\\n\\n45\\n\\n50\\n\\n55\\n\\n15\\n\\npropriate sound that is sufficiently loud enough to attract\\nthe  attention  of  other  nearby  persons  and/or  repel  an\\nattacker. In some embodiments, activating the alarm de-\\nvice can include activating a visual output configured to\\nemit an audible alert when activated. For example, the\\nmobile accessory device 100M can include the light out-\\nput device 116 that can emit a light or strobe to attract\\nthe  attention  of  other  nearby  persons  and/or  repel  an\\nattacker.\\nIn another configuration, the mobile accessory\\n[0094]\\ndevice need not be configured to be physically attachable\\nto the mobile device, but rather may be implemented as\\na standalone unit that can be carried or worn by a user\\n(e.g., as a wallet attachment or insert, key fob, bracelet,\\nor the like), and which maintains a wireless communica-\\ntion connection between the accessory and the mobile\\ndevice. In this configuration, other than the lack of phys-\\nical attachment, the accessory can be designed and im-\\nplemented to have any or all of the same features and/or\\nfunctionality as the configuration in which the accessory\\nis designed to be attached to the mobile device, as de-\\nscribed above.\\n[0095] FIGs. 47-49B illustrate various views of a mobile\\naccessory device 100N according to an additional exam-\\nple  embodiment  of  the  present  disclosure.  The  mobile\\naccessory device 100N is configured to be attached to\\nthe mobile phone 200, either directly or indirectly, as will\\nbe discussed further below. The overall configuration and\\nfeatures of the  mobile accessory device 100N may be\\nsubstantially similar to, or a subset of, that of the mobile\\naccessory  device  100  of  FIG.  1.  However,  the  mobile\\naccessory device 100N of FIGS. 47-49B may vary in one\\nor more respects.\\n[0096] The mobile accessory device 100N includes a\\nhousing 102N and a user input sensor having a movable\\ncomponent 4744 (e.g., a sliding switch, a pull tab, a trig-\\nger component),  which  serves  as  a user input mecha-\\nnism,  and  is  configured  to  activate  when  the  movable\\ncomponent 4744 is at least partially moved relative to the\\nhousing 102N, and controller (e.g., the controller 112 of\\nFIG. 7, not shown here) disposed in the housing 102N\\nand  configured  to  activate  in  response  to  activation  of\\nthe  user  input  sensor.  Activation  of  the  controller  can\\ncause an audible alarm, or cause a software application\\nto be executed on the mobile phone 200, or both. The\\naudible  alarm  can  come  either  from  an  optional  audio\\nemitting device disposed in the mobile accessory device\\n100N or (e.g., in embodiments where the mobile acces-\\nsory device 100N does not include an audio emitting de-\\nvice) from the mobile phone 200, e.g., using a speaker\\nbuilt into the mobile phone 200.\\n[0097] For example, as illustrated, the position of the\\ncomponents of the mobile accessory device 100N rela-\\ntive to a housing 102N may vary. The movable compo-\\nnent 4744 is configured to remain in a stowed (e.g., un-\\nextended) configuration until the user slide the movable\\ncomponent 4744 away from the stowed configuration rel-\\native to the housing 102N. Moving or releasing the mov-\\n\\n\\x0c29 \\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n30 \\n\\nable component 4744 may activate one or more features.\\nFor  example,  in  response  to  the  movable  component\\n4744 being moved, removed (at least in part), shifted, or\\nreleased,  the  position  location  detector  system  154  or\\n210 (see, FIG. 7) may be instructed to activate via the\\ncommunication mechanisms described above. Further,\\nthe user’s location may be tracked, e.g., using GPS-like\\nfunctionality built into the mobile accessory device 100N\\nor the mobile phone 200, during the time period in which\\nthe movable component 4744 is out of its default position\\nand thereby the user’s location information may option-\\nally be shared with one or more persons, if desired, e.g.,\\nusing  the  communications  capabilities  of  the  mobile\\nphone 200 or the mobile accessory device 100N (e.g.,\\nphone, email, SMS text).\\n[0098] Further, the mobile accessory device 100N may\\ninclude a slot 4726, a recess, a depression, a textured\\narea,  or  a  feature  providing  equivalent  functionality  to\\nease movement of the moveable component 4744, po-\\nsitioned between the movable component 4744 and the\\nhousing 102N. In this regard, in some embodiments the\\nuser input sensor arrangement may be activated, for ex-\\nample, by engaging a fingertip or fingernail or equivalent\\nin  the  slot  4726  and  moving  the  movable  component\\n4744.  Thereby,  based  on  user  input,  activation  of  the\\nuser separation sensor arrangement may be conducted\\nquickly  (e.g., in an unexpected  dangerous situation),  if\\nnecessary, for example, by moving (at least in part) the\\nmovable component 4744.\\nIn some embodiments, the movable component\\n[0099]\\n4744, which serves as a user input mechanism, may be\\nsupplemented or substituted with one or more other me-\\nchanical features configured to provide frictional, grippa-\\nble, or graspable surface or element to ease releasing\\nor  moving  the movable component 4744. Examples of\\nsuch mechanical features can include raised or recessed\\nribs, dimples, latches, loops, hooks, projections, textures\\n(e.g., rough, soft, sticky), or combinations of these or oth-\\ner mechanical features that can promote manual opera-\\ntion (e.g., movement or removal) of the movable compo-\\nnent 4744.\\n[0100] Alternatively,  or  in  addition,  other  user  input\\nmechanisms (e.g., switches or buttons) may be used as\\na user input mechanism to trigger actuation of the mobile\\naccessory  device  100N.  In  one  such  embodiment,  a\\nswitch 128N (e.g., a button) is arranged on a lateral side\\n4710a of the housing 102N, substantially perpendicular\\nto  a  major  face  surface  4712.  Another  switch  129N  is\\narranged on a lateral side 4710b of the housing 102N,\\nsubstantially  perpendicular  to  the  major  face  surface\\n4712 opposite the switch 129N. The switch 128N and/or\\nthe switch 129N may be a depressible button, pressure\\nsensitive, or membrane switches defined as a fingertip-\\nsized recess or protrusion having a textured pattern (e.g.,\\nto  facilitate  identification  and  location  of  the  switch  by\\neither sight or touch).  In use, the  switch 128N  and the\\nswitch  129N  are  pressed  substantially  simultaneously.\\nFor example, in the illustrated configuration, a user can\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n35\\n\\n40\\n\\n45\\n\\n50\\n\\n55\\n\\n16\\n\\nsqueeze the switch 128N and the switch 129N with two\\ndifferent fingers of one hand in order to activate an alarm,\\nthereby reducing a likelihood of false alarms due to ac-\\ncidental actuation of a single button. The switches may\\nbe used to activate an alarm or non-alarm function though\\na predetermined continuous press (e.g., three seconds),\\nthrough a predetermined  series of presses (e.g.,  three\\npresses within five seconds), or through a particular se-\\nquence of presses (e.g., first pressing the switch 128N\\nand then the switch 129N), for example, to reduce the\\noccurrence  of  accidental  activation.  In  some  embodi-\\nments, the user input mechanism can be configured to\\ndifferentiate  between  and  respond  to  multiple  different\\nuser inputs. For example, the user can use one prede-\\ntermined  combination  of buttons and press patterns  to\\nactivate one  response,  and  can  use  another  predeter-\\nmined combination to active another response. In a more\\nspecific  example, one press the  switch 128N could be\\nused  to  activate  a  texting  application  on  the  mobile\\nphone, two presses could be used to activate a camera\\napp  on  the  mobile  phone,  and  three  presses  could  be\\nused to activate one or more of the alarm functions.\\n[0101] Alternatively,  or  in  addition,  other  user  input\\nmechanisms (e.g., microphones, audio sensors) may be\\nused as a user input mechanism to trigger actuation of\\nthe mobile accessory device 100N. In one such embod-\\niment, the mobile accessory device 100N can include a\\nmicrophone and sound detector circuit (e.g., the sound\\ndetector arrangement 150 and the microphone 152). The\\nsound detector circuit can be  configured to respond  to\\npredetermined sounds or sound patterns as a user input\\n(e.g.,  voice  commands,  shouts,  alarms,  horns,  sirens,\\nbeeps, bells). In some implementations, the sound de-\\ntector  circuit  can  respond  to  sounds  as  user  inputs by\\ntriggering its internal  alarm  functions,  by  triggering  an-\\nother device (e.g., activating an application on a mobile\\nphone  to  send  a  message  for  help,  causing  a  mobile\\nphone to emit an audible or visual alarm), or by triggering\\nan existing function of another device (e.g., activating a\\nvoice assistant or other voice-responsive feature of a mo-\\nbile phone or other device in communication with the mo-\\nbile accessory device 100N).\\nIn  some  implementations,  the  switches  128N\\n[0102]\\nand  129N  may  activate  a  different  type  of  action  than\\nmay be triggered by separation of the movable compo-\\nnent  4744.  For  example,  the  mobile  accessory  device\\n100N  may  respond  to  activation  of  the  switches  128N\\nand 129N by initiating a silent alarm to alert one or more\\npredetermined recipients (e.g., causing the mobile phone\\n200 to discretely send a message to a preselected con-\\ntact), while the mobile accessory device 100N may re-\\nspond  to  movement  or  partial  removal  of  the  movable\\ncomponent 4744 by initiating an audible alarm and alert-\\ning one or more predetermined recipients (e.g., set off a\\nsiren and send a message or place a phone call to police).\\nThe audible alarm can come either from an optional audio\\nemitting device disposed in the mobile accessory device\\n100N or (e.g., in embodiments where the mobile acces-\\n\\n\\x0c31 \\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n32 \\n\\nsory device 100N does not include an audio emitting de-\\nvice) from the mobile phone 200, e.g., using a speaker\\nbuilt into the mobile phone 200.\\nIn some embodiments, the movable component\\n[0103]\\n4744 (e.g., pull tab) can be configured to be at least partly\\nmoved relative to the housing 102N when subjected to\\na predetermined force. In some embodiments, the mobile\\naccessory device 100N can include a wearable compo-\\nnent having a lanyard (e.g., the example wearable com-\\nponent  120)  configured  to  mechanically  attach  to  the\\nhousing 102N and/or the movable component 4744 and\\nprovide at least the predetermined force to the movable\\ncomponent based on a pull of upon the lanyard and at\\nleast partly move the movable component relative to the\\nhousing 102N based on the pull.\\n[0104] The mobile accessory device 100N has a rear\\nsurface 4702 substantially parallel to the major face sur-\\nface 4712. In the illustrated example, an adhesive pad\\n4810 is affixed to the rear surface 4702. In use, the ad-\\nhesive pad 4801 can be pressed against another surface\\n(e.g.,  the  rear  of  the  mobile  phone  200)  to  attach  the\\nmobile accessory device 100N to the other surface.\\n[0105] FIGs. 49A and 49B illustrate a sectional view of\\nthe example mobile accessory device 100N of FIG. 47.\\nThese views are provided to show the configuration and\\noperation of the movable component 4744 relative to the\\nhousing 102N.\\n[0106] FIG. 49A shows  the mobile accessory device\\n100N in a first configuration (e.g., a triggered configura-\\ntion).  The  movable  component  4744  is  configured  to\\nmove linearly along the slot 4726. FIG. 49B shows the\\nmobile accessory device 100N in a second configuration\\n(e.g., a default, un-triggered configuration). The movable\\ncomponent 4744 can be slid along the slot 4726 (e.g.,\\ninward, toward the center of the housing 102N) to change\\nthe movable component 4744 from the first configuration\\nto the second configuration, and the movable component\\n4744 can be slid along the slot 4726 (e.g., outward, away\\nfrom the center of the housing 102N) to change the mov-\\nable component 4744 from the second configuration to\\nthe first configuration (e.g., to trigger an alarm function).\\nAs  the  movable  component  4744  is  actuated  between\\nthe two configurations, the movable component 4744 ac-\\ntivates and releases a switch 4901 (e.g., as part of the\\nuser input sensor 122).\\n[0107] FIG.  50  illustrates  a  perspective  from  view  of\\nthe example mobile accessory device 100N of FIGs. 47\\nand 49B an example companion mobile accessory de-\\nvice 5000. FIG. 51 illustrates a perspective rear view of\\nthe  example  mobile  accessory  device  100N  and  com-\\npanion mobile accessory device 5000. FIGs. 50 and 51\\nshows the mobile accessory device 100N adhered or af-\\nfixed  to  the  companion  mobile  accessory  device  5000\\n(e.g., a wallet for holding identification cards, credit cards,\\ncash, or the like). In some embodiments, the companion\\nmobile accessory device 5000 can, in turn, be adhered,\\naffixed, or otherwise coupled to the mobile phone 200.\\n[0108] Referring now to FIG. 51. A rear side 5002 of\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n35\\n\\n40\\n\\n45\\n\\n50\\n\\n55\\n\\n17\\n\\nthe companion mobile accessory device 5000 includes\\nan adhesive pad 5001. In use, the adhesive pad 5001\\ncan be contacted against a surface of the mobile phone\\n200 (e.g., the rear surface 202), or any other appropriate\\nsurface. The companion mobile accessory device 5000\\ndefines a cavity 5003. The cavity 5003 is configured to\\nremovably retain one or more wallet-sized cards 5004,\\nsuch  as  credit  cards, identification  cards  (e.g.,  driver’s\\nlicense),  loyalty  cards,  security  access  cards,  folded\\ncash, or any other appropriately sized items.\\n[0109] FIG. 52 illustrates a partially exploded perspec-\\ntive side view of the example mobile accessory device\\n100N and the companion mobile accessory device 5000.\\nIn the illustrated example, the companion mobile acces-\\nsory device 5000 includes a collection of pins 5201 and\\ntabs  5202,  and  the  mobile  accessory  device  100N  in-\\ncludes a corresponding collection of bores 5203 and slots\\n5204. The pins 5201 and the bores 5203, and the tabs\\n5202 and the slots 5204 are configured to matingly en-\\ngage to mechanically affix the companion mobile acces-\\nsory device 5000 to the mobile accessory device 100N.\\n[0110] FIGs.  53  and  54 illustrate an  example  mobile\\naccessory  device  5300  having  magnetic  features.  In\\nsome embodiments, the mobile accessory device 5300\\ncan be a modification of the example mobile accessory\\ndevice 100N of FIGs. 47-49B, or the combination of the\\nmobile  accessory  device  100N  and  the  example  com-\\npanion  mobile  accessory  device  5000  device  of  FIGs.\\n50-52.\\n[0111] The mobile accessory device 5300 includes a\\nhousing 5302, and the housing 5302 includes an attach-\\nment component 5310 that is configured to magnetically\\nengage  corresponding  magnetic  features  provided  on\\nthe rear surface 202 of the mobile phone 200. In some\\nembodiments, the attachment component 5310 can be\\nmade of a magnet, a collection of magnets, a magnetic\\nmaterial, or combination of these and any other appro-\\npriate  passively  or  actively  magnetic  components  that\\ncan  magnetically  couple  the  mobile  accessory  device\\n5300 to the mobile phone 200.\\nIn  some  embodiments,  the  mobile  accessory\\n[0112]\\ndevice  5300  can  include  sensors  that  can  determine\\nwhether or not the mobile accessory device 5300 is at-\\ntached, coupled, or otherwise substantially abutted to the\\nmobile phone 200. For example, the mobile accessory\\ndevice 5300 can include a switch (e.g., a momentary pin\\nswitch  that  is  kept  depressed  by  contact  between  the\\nmobile accessory device 5300 and the rear surface 202\\nand released when the two become separated), a phot-\\nonic sensor (e.g., an illuminator and a photodetector that\\ncan detect  the presence  or  absence  of illumination re-\\nflected off the rear surface  202), or  a magnetic  sensor\\n(e.g., a Hall sensor or reed switch in the mobile accessory\\ndevice 5300 that is configured to be activated when mo-\\nbile accessory device 5300 is moved too far away from\\nthe magnetic features provided on the rear surface 202).\\nIn  some  embodiments,  the  mobile  accessory  device\\n5300 can include a wearable component such as a tether\\n\\n\\x0c33 \\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n34 \\n\\nor a lanyard (e.g., the example wearable component 120)\\nconfigured to  mechanically attach  to the  housing 5302\\nand provide at least a predetermined force to the housing\\n5302  based on a pull of  upon the  lanyard  and  at least\\npartly separate the mobile accessory device 5300 from\\nthe mobile phone 200 based on the pull.\\n[0113] FIG.s  55A  and  55B  illustrate  perspective  and\\nside views of an example of a mobile accessory device\\nbutton 5500 according to an additional example embod-\\niment of the present disclosure. The mobile accessory\\ndevice button  5500 is configured to be attached to the\\nmobile phone 200, either directly or indirectly, as will be\\ndiscussed further  below. The overall configuration and\\nfeatures of the mobile accessory device button 5500 may\\nbe substantially similar to, or a subset of, that of the mo-\\nbile accessory device 100 of FIG. 1. However, the mobile\\naccessory device button 5500 may vary in one or more\\nrespects.\\n[0114] The  mobile  accessory  device  button  5500  in-\\ncludes a housing 5502 and a button 5504 that serves as\\na  user  input  mechanism,  and  is  configured  to  activate\\nwhen the button 5504 is at least partially moved relative\\nto the housing 5502, and controller (e.g., the controller\\n112 of FIG. 7, not shown here) disposed in the housing\\n5502 and configured to activate in response to activation\\nof the user input sensor. In the illustrated example, the\\nhousing 5502 and the button 5504 are configured with a\\ngenerally convex (e.g., domed) shape.\\n[0115] Activation of the controller can cause an audible\\nalarm, or cause a software application to be executed on\\nthe mobile phone  200,  or both. The audible alarm can\\ncome either from an optional audio emitting device dis-\\nposed  in  the  mobile  accessory  device  button  5500  or\\n(e.g., in embodiments where the mobile accessory de-\\nvice button 5500 does not include an audio emitting de-\\nvice) from the mobile phone 200, e.g., using a speaker\\nbuilt into the mobile phone 200. Alternatively, or in addi-\\ntion,  other  user  input  mechanisms  (e.g.,  microphones,\\naudio sensors) may be used as a user input mechanism\\nto trigger actuation of the mobile accessory device button\\n5500.\\n[0116] A rear side 5506 of the mobile accessory device\\nbutton 5500 includes an adhesive pad 5508. In use, the\\nadhesive pad 5001 can be contacted against a surface\\nof the mobile phone 200 (e.g., the rear surface 202), or\\nany other appropriate surface. For example, the mobile\\naccessory device button 5500 can be affixed, engaged,\\nadhered, or other otherwise coupled atop a one-handed\\nphone holder that is attached to the mobile phone 200.\\nIn some embodiments, the mobile accessory device but-\\nton  5500  can  include  magnetic,  adhesive,  and/or  me-\\nchanical features to enable attachment, adherence, af-\\nfixment, engagement, and/or coupling of the mobile ac-\\ncessory device button 5500, directly or indirectly, to the\\nmobile phone 200.\\n[0117] FIG.s  56A  and  56B  illustrate  perspective  and\\nside views of an example of a mobile accessory device\\nbutton 5600 according to an additional example embod-\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n35\\n\\n40\\n\\n45\\n\\n50\\n\\n55\\n\\n18\\n\\niment of the present  disclosure. The  mobile accessory\\ndevice button 5600  is configured to be attached  to the\\nmobile phone 200, either directly or indirectly, as will be\\ndiscussed  further below.  The  overall  configuration and\\nfeatures of the mobile accessory device button 5600 may\\nbe substantially similar to, or a subset of, that of the mo-\\nbile accessory device 100 of FIG. 1. However, the mobile\\naccessory device button 5600 may vary in one or more\\nrespects.\\n[0118] The  mobile  accessory  device  button  5600  in-\\ncludes a housing 5602 and a button 5604 that serves as\\na  user  input  mechanism,  and  is  configured  to  activate\\nwhen the button 5604 is at least partially moved relative\\nto the housing 5602, and controller (e.g., the controller\\n112 of FIG. 7, not shown here) disposed in the housing\\n5602 and configured to activate in response to activation\\nof the user input sensor. In the illustrated example, the\\nhousing 5602 and the button 5604 are configured with a\\ngenerally concave (e.g., scalloped, indented, recessed)\\nshape.\\n[0119] Activation of the controller can cause an audible\\nalarm, or cause a software application to be executed on\\nthe mobile  phone 200, or both.  The audible  alarm  can\\ncome either from an optional audio emitting device dis-\\nposed  in  the  mobile  accessory  device  button  5600  or\\n(e.g., in embodiments where the mobile accessory de-\\nvice button 5600 does not include an audio emitting de-\\nvice) from the mobile phone 200, e.g., using a speaker\\nbuilt into the mobile phone 200. Alternatively, or in addi-\\ntion,  other  user  input  mechanisms  (e.g.,  microphones,\\naudio sensors) may be used as a user input mechanism\\nto trigger actuation of the mobile accessory device button\\n5600.\\n[0120] A rear side 5606 of the mobile accessory device\\nbutton 5600 includes an adhesive pad 5608. In use, the\\nadhesive pad 5001 can be contacted against a surface\\nof the mobile phone 200 (e.g., the rear surface 202), or\\nany other appropriate surface. For example, the mobile\\naccessory device button 5600 can be affixed, engaged,\\nadhered, or other otherwise coupled atop a one-handed\\nphone holder that is attached to the mobile phone 200.\\nIn some embodiments, the mobile accessory device but-\\nton  5600  can  include  magnetic,  adhesive,  and/or  me-\\nchanical features to enable attachment, adherence, af-\\nfixment, engagement, and/or coupling of the mobile ac-\\ncessory device button 5600, directly or indirectly, to the\\nmobile phone 200.\\n[0121] FIG. 57 is a flow chart of an example process\\n5700  using  an  example  mobile  accessory  device.  In\\nsome  implementations,  the  process  5700  can  be  per-\\nformed using one or more of the example mobile device\\naccessories 100A-100N an5 5300-5600  of FIGs.  1-23,\\nand  25-35,  the  personal  safety  device  300  of  FIG.  23,\\nthe mobile accessory device 100M of FIGs. 37a-43, the\\nmobile accessory device 100N of FIGs. 47-52, the mobile\\naccessory device 5300 of FIGs. 53-54, and the mobile\\naccessory device buttons 5500 and 5600 of FIG.s 55A-\\n56B.\\n\\n\\x0c35 \\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n36 \\n\\n[0122] At an option step 5710, an attachment surface\\nof a housing of a mobile accessory device is engaged to\\na mobile device. For example, the surface 4801 of the\\nhousing 102N may be configured to engage the rear sur-\\nface 202 of the mobile phone 200. In another example,\\nthe attachment component 5310 shown in FIG. 53 can\\nbe used to secure (e.g., magnetically couple) the mobile\\naccessory device 5300 to the mobile phone 200.\\n[0123] At 5720, a user input of the mobile accessory\\ndevice is received. For example, one or a combination\\nor a pattern of the switches 128N, 129N may have been\\npressed by a user. In another example, the movable com-\\nponent 4744 may have been actuated or partly moved\\nby a user. In another example, the button 5504 may be\\npressed by a user.\\n[0124] At 5730, a user input sensor detects that, based\\non the received user input, the mobile accessory device\\nhas been actuated. For example, the user input sensor\\n122  can  determine  that  the  movable  component  4744\\nhas been moved, removed (at least partially), released,\\nor shifted, or that the switch 128N and/or the button 129N\\nhas been pressed.\\nIn  some  embodiments, the  process 5700 can\\n[0125]\\ninclude detecting a mechanical separation of the housing\\nand a lanyard affixed to a wearable component, the lan-\\nyard  having  a  predetermined  length  and  mechanically\\nconnecting the wearable component to the housing, the\\nlanyard being mechanically separable from the housing\\nwhen  distance  between  the  wearable  component  and\\nthe housing exceeds the predetermined length. For ex-\\nample, the movable component 4744 can be connected\\nto the wearable component 120, and the user input sen-\\nsor 122 can determine that the wearable component 120\\nhas caused the movable component 4744 to move or at\\nbe at least partly removed from the housing 102N.\\n[0126] At  5740,  a  device  function  is  activated based\\non detecting that the user input has been actuated. For\\nexample, the controller 112 of FIG. 7 can be activated.\\nIn some embodiments, activating the device function can\\ninclude  transmitting  an  alarm  signal;  and  wherein  the\\nprocess 5700 can also include receiving, by mobile de-\\nvice, the alarm signal, and sending, by the mobile device\\nand in response to the receiving the alarm signal, a pre-\\ndetermined  communication  to  one  or  more  predefined\\nrecipients. For example, the controller 112 of FIG. 7 can\\nactivate  the communication interface 134 to communi-\\ncate with the mobile phone 200. The mobile phone 200\\nmay have a software application installed and executing\\nthereupon, and the software application can be config-\\nured to react to the communication from the mobile ac-\\ncessory device 100M to cause the mobile phone to com-\\nmunicate  with  one  or  more  predetermined  recipients,\\nand/or to emit an audible alarm or other sound. For ex-\\nample, the software application may be configured to in-\\nitiate a call, send a text message, email, media file, media\\nstream, location information (e.g., GPS data), captured\\naudio and/or video, or any other appropriate information\\nto one or more contacts previously identified by the user\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n35\\n\\n40\\n\\n45\\n\\n50\\n\\n55\\n\\n19\\n\\n(e.g., family member, friend, neighbor, doctor, nurse, car-\\negiver,  welfare  official,  emergency  services,  911).  In\\nsome embodiments, the device function can be any ap-\\npropriate circuit and/or mechanism that is configured for\\ntaking a predetermined action in response to a trigger,\\nand does not necessarily require nor preclude that the\\nalarm  device is  itself capable  of  generating an audible\\nalarm.\\nIn  some  embodiments,  activating  the  device\\n[0127]\\nfunction can include activating an audio output compo-\\nnent disposed within the housing and configured to emit\\nan audible alert when activated. For example, the mobile\\naccessory device 100N can include the audio output de-\\nvice 114 that can emit a siren, noise, prerecorded or syn-\\nthesized spoken words or other sounds, or any other ap-\\npropriate sound that is sufficiently loud enough to attract\\nthe  attention  of  other  nearby  persons  and/or  repel  an\\nattacker. In some embodiments, activating the alarm de-\\nvice can include activating a visual output configured to\\nemit an audible alert when activated. For example, the\\nmobile accessory device 100N can include the light out-\\nput device 116 that can emit a light or strobe to attract\\nthe  attention  of  other  nearby  persons  and/or  repel  an\\nattacker.\\nIn  some  embodiments,  activating  the  device\\n[0128]\\nfunction can include  activating a  non-alarm  function  of\\nthe  device.  For  example,  the  mobile  accessory  device\\n100N can be configured to respond to activation by com-\\nmunicating with the mobile phone 200. The mobile device\\ncan be configured (e.g., with an application executing on\\nthe mobile phone 200) to receive the communication and\\nrespond by activating a function of the mobile phone 200\\n(e.g., opening an app, taking a photo, triggering an alarm,\\nactivating  a  voice  assistant  into  a  standby  or  listening\\nmode).\\nIn another configuration, the mobile accessory\\n[0129]\\ndevice need not be configured to be physically attachable\\nto the mobile device, but rather may be implemented as\\na standalone unit that can be carried or worn by a user\\n(e.g., as a wallet attachment or insert, key fob, bracelet,\\nor the like), and which maintains a wireless communica-\\ntion connection between the accessory and the mobile\\ndevice. In this configuration, other than the lack of phys-\\nical attachment, the accessory can be designed and im-\\nplemented to have any or all of the same features and/or\\nfunctionality as the configuration in which the accessory\\nis designed to be attached to the mobile device, as de-\\nscribed above.\\n[0130] Although a few implementations have been de-\\nscribed in detail above, other modifications are possible.\\nFor example, the logic flows depicted in the figures do\\nnot require the particular order shown, or sequential or-\\nder, to achieve desirable results. In addition, other steps\\nmay be provided, or steps may be eliminated, from the\\ndescribed flows, and other components may be added\\nto, or removed from, the described systems. Accordingly,\\nother implementations are within the scope of the follow-\\ning claim.\\n\\n\\x0c37 \\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n38 \\n\\nEMBODIMENTS:\\n\\n[0131] Although the present invention is defined in the\\nclaims, it should be understood that the present invention\\ncan also (alternatively) be defined in accordance with the\\nfollowing embodiments:\\n\\n1.

the form of an\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n\\nalarm accessory for a mobile device. In general, a mobile\\ndevice,  e.g.,  a  cellular  telephone  (phone)  or  a  mobile\\nphone, can be modified (e.g., attached to an accessory\\nand/or  through  the  use  of  specialized  software  on  the\\nmobile device), to respond to one or more predetermined\\nconditions to automatically, and/or with user interaction,\\ntrigger an alarm and thereby draw attention to that per-\\nson’s present circumstances in order to seek help and/or\\nscare away a potential threat. Accordingly, this document\\ndescribes, among other things, an accessory that can be\\nattached  to  the  mobile  device  and  provide  enhanced\\nsafety functionality to a user of the mobile device. Various\\nconfigurations of such a mobile accessory device and its\\nuse are described herein, and may include various com-\\nbinations  of  the  following  features  and/or  functionality.\\nThe accessory may be embodied in many different forms\\nand should not be construed as limited to the implemen-\\ntations set forth herein. As used in the specification, and\\nin the appended claims, the singular forms \"a\", \"an\", \"the\",\\ninclude plural variations unless the  context clearly  dic-\\ntates otherwise.\\n[0015] As illustrated in FIGS. 1-6, the present disclo-\\nsure relates to a mobile accessory device 100, also re-\\nferred to a mobile accessory device. The mobile acces-\\nsory device 100 may be configured for use with a mobile\\ndevice such as a mobile phone 200 or other mobile device\\n(e.g., tablet computer, notebook computer, etc.). In par-\\nticular, the mobile accessory device 100 may be config-\\nured to engage (e.g., adhere to or otherwise be physically\\njoined to) the mobile phone 200. The mobile accessory\\ndevice 100 may be configured to engage any portion of\\nthe mobile phone 200, such as  the rear surface of the\\nhousing of the mobile phone 200. In some embodiments,\\nthe mobile accessory device 100 may be a stand-alone\\ndevice that does not physically engage to a mobile de-\\nvice.\\nIn  one  implementation,  the  mobile  accessory\\n[0016]\\ndevice 100 may include a housing 102. The housing 102\\nmay  define  an  attachment  (e.g.,  locking)  surface  104\\n(see, FIG. 2) and an outer surface 106 (see, e.g., FIG.\\n1). As illustrated in FIG. 2, the attachment surface 104\\nmay be configured to engage a rear surface 202 of the\\nmobile phone 200 opposite from a front surface 204 at\\nwhich  a  display  is  positioned.  Thereby,  the  mobile  ac-\\ncessory  device  100  does  not  block  the  display  in  this\\nconfiguration. Further, the mobile accessory device 100\\nmay occupy less than an entirety of an area of the rear\\nsurface 202 of the mobile phone 200. Thereby, the mobile\\naccessory device 100 may not block any rear-facing cam-\\nera thereon. Further, by providing the mobile accessory\\ndevice 100 with a relatively small size, the mobile acces-\\nsory  may  be  attached  to  mobile  phones  with  differing\\nsizes and shapes. Further, the mobile accessory device\\n100 may be configured to not extend to the edges of the\\nmobile  phone  200,  such  that  an  edge  protecting  case\\nmay be employed with the mobile phone. As may be un-\\nderstood, the mobile accessory may also be configured\\nto engage a case for the mobile phone that includes a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nrear portion that covers the rear surface (see, e.g., FIGS.\\n21 and 22). In another embodiment, the mobile acces-\\nsory  may  itself  comprise  a  case  for  the  mobile  phone\\n(see, e.g., FIG. 11).\\n[0017] The attachment surface 104 of the housing 102\\nmay be configured to substantially permanently engage\\nthe rear surface 202 of the mobile phone 200, or a case\\npositioned at the rear  surface  as noted above.  For ex-\\nample, the mobile accessory device 100 may include an\\nadhesive  at  the  attachment  surface  104  configured  to\\nadhere to the rear surface 202 of the mobile phone 200.\\nThereby, the mobile accessory device 100 may be con-\\nfigured for use over the lifetime of the mobile phone 200,\\nthereby ensuring that the mobile accessory is available\\nat all times the mobile phone is in the user’s possession.\\nAlternatively, the attachment surface 104 of the housing\\n102 may be configured to releasably engage (e.g., using\\na slot-tab arrangement, or hook and loop connecting sur-\\nfaces  such  as  VELCRO®)  the  rear  surface  202  of  the\\nmobile phone 200, or a case positioned at the rear sur-\\nface as noted above.\\n[0018] As  illustrated  in  FIG.  4,  the  mobile  accessory\\ndevice 100 may include a power source 108, which may\\nbe a battery. Further, the housing 102 may include a bat-\\ntery portion 110 that is configured to receive the power\\nsource 108. The battery portion 110 may be removable\\nto allow for replacement of the power source 108. The\\npower source 108 may be configured to provide electrical\\npower to each of the components of the mobile accessory\\ndevice 100 such that the mobile accessory is self-pow-\\nered. However, as may be understood, in another imple-\\nmentation  the  mobile  accessory  may  be  configured  to\\nreceive electrical power from the mobile phone. For ex-\\nample,  the  mobile  accessory  may  include  a connector\\nthat engages a power port or a headphone jack on the\\nmobile phone. Alternatively, or in addition, the mobile ac-\\ncessory may draw power from the phone wirelessly via\\na technique akin to QI® inductive charging, but in reverse\\n(e.g., reverse wireless charging, wireless power sharing).\\n[0019] Additional  control  circuitry  components  of  the\\nmobile accessory device 100 and the mobile phone 200\\nare schematically illustrated in FIG. 7. As illustrated, the\\nmobile accessory device 100 includes a controller 112,\\nwhich may be at least partially received in the housing\\n102. The controller 112 is in communication with the mo-\\nbile  phone  200  (e.g.,  a  communications  connection,\\nBLUETOOTH, USB) for providing signals to the mobile\\nphone 200, for example, to request, trigger, command,\\nor otherwise control operation of at least some operation\\nor actions of the mobile phone 200. The controller 112\\nmay include an audio output device 114 such as a speak-\\ner and a light output device 116 such as a light emitting\\ndiode (LED) or xenon strobe. Example positions and con-\\nfigurations of the audio output device 114 and the light\\noutput device 116 are illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 3-6.\\n[0020] As further illustrated in FIG. 7, the control cir-\\ncuitry of the mobile accessory device 100 includes a user\\nseparation sensor arrangement 118 (e.g., proximity de-\\n\\n\\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n\\ntector).  The  user  separation  sensor  arrangement  118\\nmay  include  a  wearable  component  120  configured  to\\nengage  (e.g.,  donned  by,  worn  by)  a  user  and  a  user\\ninput sensor 122 (e.g., a user input apparatus) engaged\\nwith the housing 102 and in communication with the con-\\ntroller 112. The controller 112 may be configured to ac-\\ntivate and/or perform one or more predetermined oper-\\nations in response to the user input sensor 122’s deter-\\nmining  that  the  wearable  component  120  exceeds  a\\nthreshold separation distance therefrom, and/or has be-\\ncome detached (e.g., mechanically separated) from the\\nmobile  accessory device  100, e.g.,  providing  an  alarm\\nsignal to indicate that separation between the mobile ac-\\ncessory  device  100  and  the  wearable  component  120\\nhas occurred, in response to which one or more actions\\ncan occur-e.g., sounding an audible alarm on the acces-\\nsory, emitting light from a light source on the accessory,\\ncause the attached phone’s flash light to turn on or strobe,\\ncause the attached phone to transmit a message via text\\nand/or phone call, cause the mobile phone to emit sound,\\ncause the mobile phone to take photos or begin recording\\nvideo,  either  through the forward-facing  camera or the\\nrearward-facing  camera  or  the  both,  or  otherwise  any\\noperation  within  the  attached  phone’s  functionalities.\\nNote that any phone-based action could be achieved by\\nthe accessory’s transmitting to the mobile phone that an\\nalarm condition has been detected, e.g., in response to\\nthe user’s pushing a button on the accessory, or in re-\\nsponse to the proximity between the accessory and the\\nwearable component being exceeded and/or in response\\nto the wearable component being mechanically discon-\\nnected from the accessory.\\n[0021] As further illustrated in FIG. 7, the control cir-\\ncuitry  of  the  mobile  accessory  device  100  includes  a\\nsound detector arrangement 150 (e.g., a sound detection\\ncircuit). The sound  detector arrangement 150 includes\\ncircuitry that is configured to receive sound signals from\\na  microphone  152  and  identify  one  or  more  predeter-\\nmined sounds. The controller 112 is configured to provide\\none or  more  predetermined actions  in response  to the\\nidentification  of  one  or  more  corresponding sounds. In\\nsome implementations, the sound detector arrangement\\n150 can be configured to recognize one or more utter-\\nances (e.g., words, phrases, or other sounds produced\\nby a user). In some implementations, the sound detector\\narrangement 150 can be configured to recognize one or\\nmore non-spoken sounds (e.g., screams or other sounds\\nof  distress,  smoke  alarms,  glass  breakage,  car  crash\\nsounds). The controller 112 may be configured to activate\\nand/or perform one or more predetermined operations in\\nresponse to the sound detector arrangement identifica-\\ntion of a predetermined command or sound, e.g., provid-\\ning an alarm signal in response to the user saying \"help!\"\\nor \"call 911!\" or screaming, in response to which one or\\nmore actions can occur-e.g., sounding an audible alarm\\non  the accessory,  emitting  light  from a  light  source  on\\nthe accessory, causing the attached phone’s flash light\\nto turn on or strobe, causing the attached phone to trans-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmit  a  message  via  text  and/or  phone  call,  causing  the\\nmobile phone to emit sound, causing the mobile phone\\nto take photos or begin recording video, either through\\nthe forward-facing camera or the rearward-facing cam-\\nera  or  the  both,  or  otherwise  any  operation  within  the\\nattached  phone’s  functionalities.  Note  that  any  phone-\\nbased action could be achieved by the accessory’s trans-\\nmitting to the mobile phone that an alarm condition has\\nbeen detected, e.g., in response to the user’s pushing a\\nbutton on the accessory, or in response to the proximity\\nbetween the accessory and the wearable component be-\\ning exceeded and/or in response to the wearable com-\\nponent being mechanically disconnected from the acces-\\nsory, and/or in response to detection of a predetermined\\nsound.\\nIn  some  implementations,  the  controller  112\\n[0022]\\nmay  be configured  to activate  a function of  the  mobile\\nphone 200 in response to the sound detector arrange-\\nment identification of a predetermined sound. For exam-\\nple, the mobile phone 200 may be configured with a voice\\nassistant  (e.g.,  GOOGLE  ASSISTANT,  SIRI,  ALEXA,\\nCORTANA,  BIXBY),  and  the  sound  detector  arrange-\\nment 150  can be configured to recognize  one or  more\\n\"wake up\" phrases associated with voice assistants that\\nare installed on the mobile phone 200 (e.g., \"ok Google\",\\n\"hey  Siri\",  \"Alexa\",  \"hey  Cortana\",  \"hi  Bixby\"),  and  the\\naccessory 100 can send a command to the mobile phone\\n200 that will activate the corresponding voice assistant\\nto process the rest of the user’s command. In some im-\\nplementations, the microphone 152 may be configured\\nas a supplement or substitute for the microphone 211.\\nIn some implementations, the mobile accessory device\\n100 can unlock access to a voice assistant on the mobile\\nphone 200. For example, some configurations of mobile\\nphones and/or voice assistants may require the user to\\nfirst unlock the mobile phone or perform some other pre-\\nliminary action before a voice assistant can respond to\\nverbal commands. The mobile accessory device 100 can\\nrecognize a \"wake up\" word/phrase and send a command\\nto the mobile phone 200, where an application running\\nin the background on the mobile phone 200 can receive\\nthe  command  and  respond  by  unlocking  the  mobile\\nphone 200 and/or otherwise placing the voice assistant\\nin condition to respond to the user. In some implemen-\\ntations, the user can choose to opt-in to grant the phone\\napplication sufficient security privileges to bypass or oth-\\nerwise  release  phone  security  features  (e.g.,  screen\\nlocks)  that  need  to  be  dismissed  in  order  to  make  the\\nvoice assistant responsive and/or useful.\\n[0023] With regard to wearable components, as illus-\\ntrated in FIG. 5, in one embodiment the wearable com-\\nponent 120 may comprise a wrist strap. Initially, the user\\ninput  sensor  122  and  the  wearable  component  120  of\\nthe  user  separation  sensor  arrangement  118  may  be\\nphysically connected. For example, as illustrated in FIG.\\n5, a lanyard 124 (e.g., mechanical tether) may connect\\nthe wearable component 120 to the housing  102 via a\\nconnector 126.\\n\\n\\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n\\n[0024] As noted above, the controller 112 may be ac-\\ntivated  in response  to receipt of  a  signal generated by\\nthe user separation sensor arrangement 118 when the\\nuser separation sensor arrangement 118 determines that\\nthe wearable component 120 has become physically de-\\ntached from the accessory, and/or exceeds a threshold\\nseparation  distance  from  the  user  input  sensor  122.\\nThereby, the threshold separation distance may be de-\\nfined between the housing 102 and the wearable com-\\nponent 120. Thus, for example, the lanyard 124 may have\\na predetermined length that at least partially defines the\\nthreshold distance, and the lanyard may be configured\\nto mechanically and/or electrically attach to the housing\\n102 and separate from  the  housing 102 when the dis-\\ntance  between  the  wearable  component  120  and  the\\nhousing  102  exceeds  the  predetermined  length  of  the\\nlanyard  124. The  user  separation  sensor  arrangement\\n118 can include a user input sensor configured to deter-\\nmine whether the housing 102 and the lanyard are me-\\nchanically and/or electrically separated and provide an\\nalarm signal in response.\\n[0025] As illustrated in FIG. 6, when a user’s wrist to\\nwhich the wearable component 120 is attached moves\\naway from the housing 102 of the mobile accessory de-\\nvice 100 by a distance exceeding the length of the lanyard\\n124, the lanyard may pull out (e.g., separate, break away)\\nthe connector 126 from the housing 102 and out of en-\\ngagement with the user input sensor 122, thereby acti-\\nvating the controller 112 (see, FIG. 7).\\n[0026] Further, in one embodiment the connector 126\\nmay include a whistle. Thereby, once the connector 126\\nis removed from the housing 102, the user may blow on\\nthe whistle to bring attention to the user’s circumstances,\\nscare away an assailant, and/or summon help.\\nIn an alternate embodiment, the connector ex-\\n[0027]\\ntending from the wearable component may be configured\\nto engage a power and/or data port of the mobile phone\\nor  a  headphone  jack  thereon.  In  this  embodiment,  the\\nmobile phone may itself (e.g., via a software application\\nexecuting  on  the  mobile  phone)  detect  detachment  or\\nseparation of the wearable component from the port or\\njack, thereby activating the alarm device.\\n[0028] As schematically illustrated in FIG. 7, the mobile\\naccessory  device  100  may  also  include  a  switch  128.\\nThe switch 128 may be provided in addition to, or as an\\nalternate  for,  the  user  separation  sensor  arrangement\\n118. In a preferred embodiment, both the user separation\\nsensor arrangement 118 and the switch 128 are provid-\\ned.\\n[0029] An example embodiment of  the  switch 128 is\\nillustrated in FIGS. 1 and 3-6. In some embodiments it\\nmay be desirable to provide the switch 128 with features\\nconfigured to prevent accidental actuation thereof so as\\nto avoid accidental activation of the controller 112 (see,\\nFIG. 7). In this regard, in some embodiments actuation\\nof the switch 128 may require movement of the switch\\nalong a non-linear path. For example, FIG. 8 illustrates\\nan enlarged example embodiment of an embodiment of\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe switch 128A. As illustrated, the switch 128A may in-\\nclude a center button 130 and a slider 132. In order to\\nactivate the switch 128A, a user may slide the slider 132\\nin order to depress the center button 130. Thereby, issues\\nwith respect to accident actuation of the switch 128A may\\nbe  mitigated.  Various  other  switches  requiring  multi-\\nstage actuation may be provided in other embodiments.\\n[0030] The controller 112 may be configured to be ac-\\ntivated in response to a signal from the user separation\\nsensor arrangement 118 and/or the switch 128. The par-\\nticular response by the controller 112 may be set as de-\\nsired. In some embodiments activation of the controller\\n112 by the switch 128 may result in the same response\\nas activation of the alarm device by the user separation\\nsensor  arrangement  118.  However,  in  other  embodi-\\nments activation of the controller 112 by the switch 128\\nmay result in a different response as compared to acti-\\nvation of the alarm device by the user separation sensor\\narrangement 118.\\n[0031] For example, the controller 112 may be config-\\nured  to  output  an  audible  alarm  configured  to  output\\nsounds,  predetermined  spoken  words,  and/or  noises\\n(e.g., siren, buzzer, bell, speech) that are loud enough\\nto attract attention from others in the vicinity of the mobile\\nphone  200  when  the  user  separation  sensor  arrange-\\nment 118 determines that the threshold separation dis-\\ntance is exceeded. In this regard, one or both of the audio\\noutput device 114 and the light output device 116 may\\nbe activated. However, in some configurations, the con-\\ntroller 112 may be silently activated when the switch 128\\nis actuated (e.g., the controller 112 or the mobile phone\\n200 may be configured to omit the emission of an atten-\\ntion-getting  sound  during  activation).  In  some  embodi-\\nments, a silent alarm can refer to any appropriate circuit\\nand/or mechanism for taking a predetermined action in\\nresponse to a trigger, and does not necessarily require\\n(nor preclude) that the alarm device is itself incapable of\\ngenerating an audible alarm.\\nIn this regard, the controller 112 may be config-\\n[0032]\\nured to direct the mobile phone 200 to send a communi-\\ncation (e.g., a telephone call, an SMS text message, an\\ninstant message, and email) to one or more predefined\\nrecipients in response to actuation of the switch 128. In\\nsome implementations, the communication can include\\none or more predetermined messages (e.g., pre-record-\\ned  voice  message,  pre-configured  text  or  synthesized\\nvoice message). In some implementations, the commu-\\nnication can be sent to one or more predetermined re-\\ncipients (e.g., emergency response center, 911, police,\\nuser contacts). The controller 112 may be configured to\\ndirect the mobile phone 200 to send a communication to\\none or more predefined recipients when the user sepa-\\nration  sensor  arrangement  118  determines  that  the\\nthreshold separation distance from the wearable compo-\\nnent 120 is exceeded, and/or that the wearable compo-\\nnent 120 has become detached from the mobile acces-\\nsory device 100.\\n[0033] The controller 112 may be configured to direct\\n\\n\\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n\\nthe mobile phone 200 to activate a camera 207 (e.g., to\\ncapture still or motion video of the surroundings), a mi-\\ncrophone 211 (e.g., to capture sounds in the surrounding\\nenvironment),  a  position  location  detector  system  154\\n(e.g., GPS or other location system to identify a local or\\nglobal location of the phone), light output system to emit\\na visual indicator (e.g., blink an onboard LED, flash the\\nphone’s screen), and/or audio output system (e.g., built-\\nin speaker of the phone, to emit an audible alarm or call\\nfor help) of the mobile phone 200, In some implementa-\\ntions, the communication can include one or more of a\\ndistress  message,  positioning  coordinates  of  a  deter-\\nmined position location (e.g., based on a GPS sensor in\\nthe mobile device), audio captured by mobile device, and\\nvideo captured by the mobile device. The functionality of\\nbeing able to send a communication in response to an\\nalarm  or  other  predetermined condition  may  be imple-\\nmented by specialized software installed on and execut-\\ned by  the mobile device, for example, a downloadable\\nsoftware application (e.g., app) or other software com-\\nponent.\\n[0034] To transmit such notifications, as schematically\\nillustrated  in  FIG.  7,  the  mobile  accessory  device  100\\nmay  further  comprise  a  communication  interface  134\\n(e.g., a communication circuit, communication circuitry).\\nThe communication interface 134 may be configured to\\ncommunicate with a communication interface 206 (e.g.,\\na communication circuit, communication circuitry) of the\\nmobile phone 200 when directed by the controller 112.\\nThe communication interface 134 of the mobile acces-\\nsory device 100 and the communication interface 206 of\\nthe mobile phone 200 may be any suitable arrangement,\\nsuch as a device or circuitry embodied in either hardware,\\nsoftware, or a combination thereof that is configured to\\nreceive and/or transmit data. The communication inter-\\nfaces 134, 206 may be configured to receive and/or trans-\\nmit data via a wired communication connection or wire-\\nless communication connection. In this regard, the com-\\nmunication interfaces 134, 206 may include, for example,\\nan antenna and supporting wireless transmitter, receiver,\\nor  transceiver  hardware  and/or hardwired components\\nand/or software. For example, the communication inter-\\nface 134 of the mobile accessory device 100 may include\\na wireless transmitter, receiver, or transceiver configured\\nto communicate with the communication interface 206 of\\nthe mobile phone 200 via BLUETOOTH, photonic (e.g.,\\ninfrared, IRDA), acoustic, ultrasonic, ZigBee, WiFi, or any\\nother  appropriate  communication  format.  Further,  the\\ncommunication  interface  206  of  the  mobile  phone  200\\nmay be configured to communicate with one or more cel-\\nlular networks via any known communication standard.\\n[0035] Thereby,  the  communication  interface  206  of\\nthe mobile phone 200 may send a communication to one\\nor more designated contacts. The designated contacts\\nmay be selected by the user via a user-installable soft-\\nware application that may be loaded on the mobile phone\\n200. The type and/or content of the message may also\\nbe configured within the application.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn some embodiments, the communication may\\n[0036]\\ninclude a phone call with an audible message. For ex-\\nample, a prerecorded message may be played to convey\\na request for help. Alternatively or additionally, the mobile\\nphone 200 may activate a microphone 211 thereof such\\nthat a recipient of the call may receive audio relating to\\nthe user of mobile accessory’s circumstances (e.g., voice\\nor other sounds corresponding to words or actions of the\\nmobile phone user or anyone or anything else within the\\nrange of the mobile phone’s microphone 208).\\nIn some embodiments, the communication may\\n[0037]\\ninclude a video communication. For example, the mobile\\nphone 200 may activate a camera 207 thereof such that\\na recipient of the call may receive video relating to the\\nuser of accessory’s circumstances (e.g., video and audio\\nwithin the range of the mobile device’s camera 207 and\\nmicrophone 208).\\nIn some embodiments, the communication may\\n[0038]\\ninclude a text message, an email, or any other electronic\\ncommunication.  Thereby,  the  communication  may  in-\\nclude, for example, a message conveying a request for\\nhelp and/or instructing the recipient to call police or other\\nemergency  services.  The  communication  may  also  in-\\nclude  location  data  regarding  a  position  of  the  mobile\\nphone 200. For example, the mobile phone 200 may fur-\\nther include a positioning system sensor 210 (e.g., GPS,\\nGLONASS, indoor positioning), which may determine a\\nlocation thereof, and such location information may be\\nincluded in the communication transmitted by the com-\\nmunication interface 206 of the mobile phone. In another\\nexample, the mobile accessory device 100 may further\\ninclude  a  position  location  detector  system  154  (e.g.,\\nGPS, GLONASS, indoor positioning), which may deter-\\nmine  a  location  thereof,  and  such  location  information\\nmay be included in the communication transmitted by the\\ncommunication  interface  134  of  the  mobile  accessory.\\nFor example, the recipients of the communication may\\nbe provided with an  image showing the position  of the\\nmobile  phone  200  and/or  a  link  to  a  map  showing  the\\nposition. Such a map may be updated with the positon\\nof the mobile phone 200 such that the position thereof\\nmay  be  tracked  in  the  event  that  movement  occurs.\\nThereby, emergency service personnel may be directed\\nto the location of the mobile phone 200.\\nIn another embodiment, communications may\\n[0039]\\nadditionally or alternatively be transmitted to other users\\nof mobile accessory devices in local proximity to the mo-\\nbile accessory device 100. For example, the communi-\\ncation interface 134 of the mobile accessory device 100\\nmay directly communicate with the communication inter-\\nface of other nearby mobile phone accessories to alert\\ntheir  users  of  a  nearby  user  in  need  of  assistance.  In\\nsome embodiments the mobile accessory devices 100\\nmay form a mesh network via the communication inter-\\nfaces 134 to expand the reach of the local alerts.\\n[0040] FIG. 9 schematically illustrates control circuitry\\ncomponents of the controller 112 (e.g., an alarm device)\\naccording to an embodiment of the present disclosure.\\n\\n\\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n\\nAs illustrated, the  control  circuitry of  the controller  112\\nmay  include  or  otherwise  be  in  communication  with  a\\nprocessor 136 and a memory device 138.\\n[0041] The  processor  136  may  be  embodied  in  a\\nnumber of different  forms. For example,  the processor\\n136 may be embodied as one or more of various process-\\ning means such as a coprocessor, a microprocessor, a\\ncontroller, a digital signal processor (DSP), processing\\ncircuitry,  or  various  other  processing devices  including\\nintegrated circuits such as, for example, a special-pur-\\npose computer chip, or other hardware processor. In an\\nexample embodiment, the processor 136 may be config-\\nured to execute instructions stored in the memory device\\n138 or  otherwise  accessible to the  processor. Alterna-\\ntively or additionally, the processor 136 may be config-\\nured to execute  hard coded  functionality. As such, the\\nprocessor 136 may be capable of performing operations\\naccording  to  embodiments  of  the  present  disclosure\\nwhile  configured  accordingly.  Alternatively,  when  the\\nprocessor 136 is embodied as an executor of software\\ninstructions,  the instructions may  specifically configure\\nthe processor to perform the operations described here-\\nin. The processor 136 may include a clock, an arithmetic\\nlogic  unit  (ALU)  and  logic  gates  configured  to  support\\noperation of the processor, amongst other components.\\n[0042] The memory device 138 may include non-tran-\\nsitory  and  tangible  memory  that  may  be,  for  example,\\nvolatile and/or non-volatile memory. The memory device\\n138 may be configured to store information, data, files,\\napplications,  instructions  or  the  like.  For  example,  the\\nmemory  device  138  can  be  configured  to  buffer  input\\ndata for processing by the processor 136. Additionally or\\nalternatively, the memory device 138 can be configured\\nto store instructions for execution by the processor 136.\\n[0043] The processor 136 may be configured to exe-\\ncute program code instructions stored on a non-transitory\\ncomputer readable medium. In this regard, an embodi-\\nment of a non-transitory computer readable medium for\\nstoring  computer instructions executed  by  a processor\\n(e.g., processor 136) is provided, such as the memory\\ndevice 138. The non-transitory computer readable me-\\ndium may comprise program code instructions for per-\\nforming the alarm operations described herein.\\n[0044] The various aspects, embodiments, implemen-\\ntations or features of the described embodiments can be\\nused separately or in any combination. Various aspects\\nof the described embodiments can be implemented by\\nsoftware,  hardware  or  a  combination  of  hardware  and\\nsoftware. The described embodiments can also be em-\\nbodied as computer readable code on a computer read-\\nable medium for controlling the above-described opera-\\ntions. In particular, computer readable code may be con-\\nfigured to perform each of the operations of the methods\\ndescribed  herein and embodied as computer  readable\\ncode on a computer readable medium for controlling the\\nabove-described operations. In this regard, a computer\\nreadable  storage  medium,  as  used  herein,  refers  to  a\\nnon-transitory, physical storage medium (e.g., a volatile\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nor non-volatile memory device, which can be read by a\\ncomputer system.  Examples of the  computer readable\\nmedium  include  read-only  memory,  random-access\\nmemory, CD-ROMs, DVDs, magnetic tape, and optical\\ndata  storage devices. The computer  readable  medium\\ncan also be distributed over network-coupled computer\\nsystems  so  that  the  computer  readable  code  is  stored\\nand executed in a distributed fashion.\\n[0045] Although the present disclosure is generally de-\\nscribed as relating to a mobile accessory, in another em-\\nbodiment some or all of the components of the mobile\\naccessory described above may be included in a stan-\\ndalone personal safety device (see, e.g., FIG. 23). In oth-\\ner words, a personal safety device may be configured for\\nuse  without  requiring a  separate mobile phone.  In  this\\nregard, the personal safety device may be configured to\\ncommunicate  with  cellular  networks  and  configured  to\\ndetermine a location of the personal safety device. Thus,\\nfor example, the communication interface may be con-\\nfigured to communicate with cellular or satellite networks\\nin order to allow for transmission of electronic communi-\\ncations  and  the  personal safety  device  may further in-\\nclude a GPS sensor configured to determine the location\\nof the personal safety device.\\n[0046] As noted above, the form factor of the mobile\\naccessory device 100 may vary. In this regard, FIG. 10\\nillustrates an embodiment of the mobile accessory device\\n100A including the switch 128 of FIG. 8. FIG. 11 illustrates\\nan embodiment of the mobile accessory device 100B pro-\\nvided in the form of a case. FIG. 12 illustrates an embod-\\niment of the mobile accessory device 100C wherein the\\nmobile accessory is substantially rectangular with round-\\ned corners. FIG. 13 illustrates an embodiment of the mo-\\nbile accessory device 100D wherein the mobile acces-\\nsory is round. FIG. 14 illustrates an embodiment of the\\nmobile accessory device 100E wherein the user separa-\\ntion  sensor  arrangement  includes  a  wireless  wearable\\ncomponent 120D. FIGS. 15-18 illustrate an embodiment\\nof the mobile accessory device 100F wherein the mobile\\naccessory is ovular. FIG. 19 illustrates an embodiment\\nof the mobile accessory device 100G wherein the wear-\\nable component of the user separation sensor arrange-\\nment  is  not  attached  for  illustration  purposes.  FIG.  20\\nillustrates an embodiment of the mobile accessory device\\n100H wherein a mobile phone is not attached for illustra-\\ntion purposes. FIG. 21 illustrates an embodiment of the\\nmobile  accessory  device  1001  wherein  the  mobile  ac-\\ncessory is attached to a case 208 for the mobile phone\\n200.\\nIn examples such as the mobile accessory de-\\n[0047]\\nvice 100E and the wearable component 120D of FIG. 14,\\nthe connection between the wearable component 120D\\nand the mobile accessory device 100E may be wireless.\\nFor example, the connection may be a radio frequency\\nconnection (e.g., BLUETOOTH connection), a photonic\\nconnection (e.g., infrared beacon, IrDA), sonic (e.g., ul-\\ntrasonic beacon), or magnetic (e.g., a Hall sensor in the\\nmobile accessory device activated when a magnet in the\\n\\n\\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n\\nwearable component or the mobile phone is moved too\\nfar away).\\nIn some embodiments, the user separation sen-\\n[0048]\\nsor arrangement 118 can be configured to measure or\\notherwise detect a strength of a wireless signal provided\\nby the wearable component. The strength of the signal\\ncan  be  proportional  or  otherwise  representative  of  the\\ndistance between the wearable component and the user\\nseparation sensor arrangement 118 (e.g., the larger the\\nseparation distance, the weaker the received signal will\\nbe). The user separation sensor arrangement 118 can\\ncompare the strength of the received signal to a prede-\\ntermined threshold signal strength value. If the received\\nsignal strength is determined to be less than the threshold\\nsignal  strength  value,  the  user  separation  sensor  ar-\\nrangement  118  can  provide  an  activation  signal to the\\ncontroller 112. In some embodiments, the user separa-\\ntion sensor arrangement 118 may be configured to detect\\nthe presence and/or absence of a beacon signal, and the\\nthreshold signal strength value can be a timeout value.\\nFor example, the wearable component 120D can be con-\\nfigured to emit a beacon signal once every second, and\\nthe threshold signal strength value can be set to five sec-\\nonds.  In  this  example,  the  user  separation  sensor  ar-\\nrangement 118 can determine that no beacon signal has\\nbeen received for at least five seconds, and respond by\\ndetermining  that  the  wearable  component  120D  is  no\\nlonger in proximity (and/or physically attached) to the mo-\\nbile  accessory  device  100E  and  provide  an  activation\\nsignal to the controller 112.\\n[0049] FIGs. 22A-F illustrate steps associated with us-\\nage of a wearable component 120I (e.g., a wrist strap)\\nof the mobile accessory device 1001 of FIG. 21. FIG. 22A\\nshows a mobile phone 200 having an attached (e.g., ad-\\nhesively, with tabs/slots, or hooks and loops) mobile ac-\\ncessory  device  1001.  The  microphone  of  the  mobile\\nphone 200 is shown at 208. The mobile accessory device\\n1001 includes a groove 209 defined in the surface of the\\nmobile  accessory  device  1001,  sized  to accommodate\\nstorage of the wearable component 1201. FIGs. 22B-D\\nshow  a  user  in  the  process  of  removing  the  wearable\\ncomponent 1201 from the groove 209 so that he or she\\ncan engage the wearable component 1201 into a worn\\nposition, such as shown in FIG. 22E (e.g., donned upon\\na wrist). FIG. 22F illustrates how the user might hold mo-\\nbile  phone  200  after he or she has removed wearable\\ncomponent 1201 form the groove 209 and put it around\\nhis or her wrist. The user can later remove (e.g., doff) the\\nwearable component 1201 and stow it in the groove 209.\\n[0050] FIG. 23 illustrates an embodiment of a personal\\nsafety device 300 that does not require usage of a sep-\\narate mobile phone, but rather is implemented as a stan-\\ndalone, dedicated personal  safety device. Such a  per-\\nsonal safety device 300 may have sufficient components\\nand functionalities to perform the operation\\n[0051] Further, FIGS. 24-26 illustrate an embodiment\\nof the mobile accessory device 100J according to an ad-\\nditional example embodiment of the present disclosure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe mobile accessory device 100J is illustrated as being\\nattached to the mobile phone 200 as discussed above.\\nThe overall configuration and features of the mobile ac-\\ncessory device 100J may be substantially similar to that\\nof the mobile accessory device 100 of FIG. 1. However,\\nthe mobile accessory device 100J of FIGS. 24-26 may\\nvary in one or more respects.\\n[0052] For example, as illustrated, the position of the\\ncomponents of the mobile accessory device 100J relative\\nto  the  housing  102J  may vary. In  this  regard,  the  light\\noutput device 116J may be positioned at a top center of\\nthe outer surface 106J of the housing 102J. This config-\\nuration may allow the light output device 116J to be ex-\\nposed and visible above the top of the user’s hand in the\\nevent of activation while in the user’s hand, such that it\\nis more noticeable. The audio output device 114J may\\nbe  positioned  in  a  similar  location  as  compared  to  the\\naudio output device 114 of the mobile accessory device\\n100 of FIG. 1, but the housing 102J may include a pattern\\nof round holes defined there through that allow sounds\\nto  exit  the  mobile  accessory  device  100J.  Further,  the\\nswitch  128J  may  be  substantially  similar  to  the  switch\\n128A  described  above  with  respect  to  FIG.  8,  but  the\\nends  thereof  may  be  relatively  more  rounded  for  im-\\nproved ergonomics and/or appearance. Additionally, the\\nbattery portion may be positioned at the attachment sur-\\nface of the mobile accessory device 100J engaged with\\nthe mobile phone 200 in order to de-clutter the exposed\\nouter surfaces thereof.\\n[0053] Further, the mobile accessory device 100J may\\ninclude a nail slot 140J, which may be positioned between\\nthe connector 126J and the housing 102J. In this regard,\\nin  some  embodiments  the  user  separation  sensor  ar-\\nrangement may be activated by engaging a fingernail in\\nthe nail slot 140J and releasing the connector 126 rather\\nthan requiring the user to release the wearable compo-\\nnent 120J first. Thereby, activation of the user separation\\nsensor arrangement may be conducted quickly (e.g., in\\nan unexpected dangerous situation), if necessary.\\n[0054] Further, the particular configuration of the wear-\\nable component 120J may differ. In this regard, as illus-\\ntrated in FIGS. 24-26, in an un-extended configuration,\\nthe lanyard 124J may wrap around a lower comer of the\\nhousing 102J and extend to and wrap around a top comer\\nof the housing. The wearable component 120J may then\\nextend downward from the lanyard 124J to the bottom\\nedge of the housing 102J. A clip 142J may be positioned\\nat the interface between the lanyard 124J and the wear-\\nable  component  120J.  In  some  embodiments,  the  clip\\n142J may be moveable such that the relative length of\\nthe  wearable  component  120J  relative  to  the  lanyard\\n124J is adjustable  and thereby  a  user may tighten the\\nwearable component around his or her wrist during use.\\nThe clip 142J may be configured to engage the housing\\n102J when in an un-extended configuration to retain the\\nlanyard 124J in place.\\n[0055] Further, the wearable component 120J may in-\\nclude a pull tab 144J at an end thereof. The pull tab 144J\\n\\n\\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n\\nmay retain the wearable component 120J in the un-ex-\\ntended configuration until the user releases the pull tab\\nfrom engagement with the housing 102J. Releasing the\\npull  tab  144J  from engagement with  the housing 102J\\nmay activate one or more features. For example, in re-\\nsponse to the pull tab 144J being released, the position-\\ning system sensor 210 (see, FIG. 7) may be instructed\\nto  activate  via  the  communication  mechanisms  de-\\nscribed  above.  Accordingly,  when  a  user  extends  the\\nwearable  component  120J  and  places  it  on  his  or  her\\nwrist, for example when confronted with a dangerous sit-\\nuation or location, the user’s location may be determined\\nand tracked at that time. Thereby, in the event that the\\nuser pulls out the connector 126J, the positioning system\\nsensor 210 will have already been activated in order to\\nsubstantially immediately provide the user’s location as\\ndescribed above. Thereby, for example, any delays as-\\nsociated  with  determining  the  user’s  location  may  be\\navoided. Further, the user’s location may be tracked dur-\\ning the time period during which the pull tab 144J is re-\\nleased and thereby the user’s location information may\\noptionally be shared with one or more persons, if desired.\\n[0056] The  embodiment of the mobile accessory de-\\nvice 100K illustrated in FIGS. 27 and 28 is substantially\\nsimilar to the mobile accessory of FIGS. 24-26 in most\\nrespects and hence the configuration thereof will not be\\nrepeated. However, the nail slot 140K is enlarged.\\n[0057] FIGs. 29-35 illustrate various views of another\\nexample mobile accessory device 1001 according to an\\nadditional  example  embodiment  of  the  present  disclo-\\nsure. The mobile accessory device 100L is configured to\\nbe attached to the mobile phone 200 as will be discussed\\nfurther below. The overall configuration and features of\\nthe mobile accessory device 100L may be substantially\\nsimilar to that of the mobile accessory device 100 of FIG.\\n1. However, the mobile accessory device 100L of FIGS.\\n29-35 may vary in one or more respects.\\n[0058] For example, as illustrated, the position of the\\ncomponents of the mobile accessory device 100L relative\\nto the housing 102L may vary. The audio output device\\n114L may be positioned in a similar location as compared\\nto the audio output device 114 of the mobile accessory\\ndevice 100 of FIG. 1, but the housing 102L may include\\na round hole defined there through that allow sounds to\\nexit the mobile accessory device 100L.\\n[0059] Further, the particular configuration of the wear-\\nable component 120L may differ. In this regard, as illus-\\ntrated in FIGS. 29-35, in an un-extended configuration,\\nwearable component 120L and the lanyard 124L may be\\nstow-able in a groove 2909 formed about the periphery\\nof the housing 102L. Further, the wearable component\\n120L may include a pull tab 144L at an end thereof. The\\npull tab 144L may retain the wearable component 120L\\nin the stowed (e.g., un-extended) configuration until the\\nuser releases the pull  tab 144L from engagement with\\nthe housing 102L. Releasing the pull tab 144L from en-\\ngagement  with  the  housing  102L  may  activate  one  or\\nmore features. For example, in response to the pull tab\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n144L being released, the positioning system sensor 210\\n(see, FIG. 7) may be instructed to activate via the com-\\nmunication mechanisms described above. Accordingly,\\nwhen  a  user  removes  the  wearable  component  120L\\nfrom the groove 2909 and places it on his or her wrist,\\nfor example when confronted with a dangerous situation\\nor location, the user’s location may be determined and\\ntracked at that time. Thereby, in the event that the user\\npulls out the connector 126L, the positioning system sen-\\nsor 210 will have already been activated in order to sub-\\nstantially immediately provide the user’s location as de-\\nscribed above. Thereby, for example, any delays asso-\\nciated with determining the user’s location may be avoid-\\ned.  Further,  the  user’s  location  may  be  tracked  during\\nthe time period during which the pull tab 144L is released\\nand thereby the user’s location information may option-\\nally be shared with one or more persons, if desired.\\n[0060] Further, the switch 128L may be a pressure sen-\\nsitive  or  membrane  switch  defined  as  a  fingertip-sized\\nrecess having a textured pattern (e.g., to ease identifica-\\ntion  and  location  of  the  switch  128L  by  either  sight  or\\ntouch).  In  use,  the  switch  may  be  used  to  activate  an\\nalarm  though  a  predetermined  continuous  press  (e.g.,\\nthree  seconds)  or  through  a  predetermined  series  of\\npresses (e.g., three presses within five seconds), for ex-\\nample, to reduce the occurrence of accidental activation.\\nIn some implementations, the switch 128L may activate\\na different type of alarm than may be triggered by sepa-\\nration of the lanyard. For example, the mobile accessory\\ndevice 100L may respond to activation of the switch 128L\\nby initiating a silent alarm to alert one or more predeter-\\nmined recipients (e.g., discretely sending a message to\\na preselected contact), while the mobile accessory de-\\nvice 100L may respond to separation of the connector\\n126L by initiating an audible alarm  and alerting one or\\nmore predetermined recipients (e.g., set off a siren and\\nsend a message or place a phone call to police).\\n[0061] Further, the mobile accessory device 100L may\\ninclude a nail slot positioned between the connector 126L\\nand the housing 102L. In this regard, in some embodi-\\nments the user separation sensor arrangement may be\\nactivated  by  engaging  a  fingernail  in  the  nail  slot  and\\nreleasing  the  connector  126L  rather than  requiring  the\\nuser  to  release  the  wearable  component  120L  first.\\nThereby,  activation  of  the  user  separation  sensor  ar-\\nrangement may be conducted quickly (e.g., in an unex-\\npected dangerous situation), if necessary.\\n[0062] The  mobile  accessory  device  100L  also  in-\\ncludes a visual indicator 2902 (e.g.,  a  light, a  display).\\nThe visual indicator 2902 is configured to provide a visible\\nindication of one or more statuses of the mobile acces-\\nsory device. For example, the visual indicator 2902 may\\nblink at a first rate or pattern (e.g., or illuminate steadily),\\nilluminate at a  first  brightness,  and/or  illuminate  with  a\\nfirst color to display a first condition (e.g., to indicate that\\nthe  mobile  accessory  device  100L  is  connected  to  or\\npaired with the mobile phone 200 and/or an associated\\nalarm software application  running on  the phone), and\\n\\n\\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n\\nblink,  illuminate,  and/or  colorize  in  different  predeter-\\nmined manners to display other conditions (e.g., to indi-\\ncate that the mobile accessory device 100L is not paired\\nor  otherwise  communicatively  associated  with  mobile\\nphone 200, to indicate that the mobile accessory device\\n100L is not able to communicate with the mobile phone\\n200 to which it was previously paired or otherwise com-\\nmunicatively associated). In some embodiments, the vis-\\nual indicator 2902 may display differently shaped prede-\\ntermined patterns to indicate different conditions of the\\nmobile accessory device 100L. For example, the visual\\nindicator 2902 may appear as a periodically blinking, blue\\nBLUETOOTH symbol to indicate that the mobile acces-\\nsory device 100L is ready for pairing, and may appear\\nas a red \"X\" when the mobile accessory device 100L is\\nnot able to communicate with the paired mobile phone\\n200 or an associated software application installed there-\\nupon  and  configured  to  respond  to  alarm  signals  from\\nthe mobile accessory device 100L.\\n[0063] Referring  now  to  FIG.  35,  a  rear  perspective\\nview of the mobile accessory device 100L is shown. The\\nrear side of the housing 102L includes an adhesive pad\\n3502. In use, the adhesive pad 3502 can be contacted\\nagainst a surface of the mobile phone 200 (e.g., the rear\\nsurface 202).\\n[0064] FIG. 36 is a flow chart of an example process\\n3600 for using an example mobile accessory device. In\\nsome  implementations,  the  process  3600  can  be  per-\\nformed using one or more of the example mobile device\\naccessories 100A-100L of  FIGs. 1-23, and 25-35,  and\\nthe personal safety device 300 of FIG. 23.\\n[0065] At 3610, an attachment surface of a housing of\\na mobile accessory device is engaged to a mobile device.\\nFor example, the attachment surface 104 of the housing\\n102 may be configured to engage the rear surface 202\\nof the mobile phone 200. In another example, the adhe-\\nsive pad 3502 shown in FIG. 35 can be used to secure\\nthe  mobile  accessory  device  100L  to  a  mobile  device,\\nsuch as to the rear surface 202 of the mobile phone 200.\\n[0066] At 3620, a wearable component is donned upon\\na user of the mobile device. For example, the wearable\\ncomponent 120 of FIG. 5, the wireless wearable compo-\\nnent 120D of FIG. 14, and/or the wearable component\\n1201 of FIGs 22A-F can be worn about a user’s wrist. In\\nother  examples,  the  wearable  component  can  donned\\nupon or otherwise carried by a user (e.g., a pendant, a\\nring, an earring, an earpiece, bracelet, wristwatch, eye-\\nglass frame, hair clip), the user’s clothing (e.g., a remote\\nunit carried in the user’s pocket, a pin, a badge, clipped\\nto a belt, a belt buckle, head band, hat), and/or the user’s\\npersonal effects (e.g., a remote unit carried in purse or\\nbag, a key fob, an identification card).\\n[0067] At  3630,  a  separation sensor  detects  that the\\nwearable  component  has  separated from  the  housing.\\nFor example, the user input sensor 122 can determine\\nthat  the  wearable  component  120  has  exceeded  a\\nthreshold  separation  distance  from  the  controller  112\\nand/or  that  the  wearable  component  120  has  become\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nphysically  detached  from  the  mobile  accessory  device\\n100.\\nIn some embodiments,  the process  3600  can\\n[0068]\\ninclude detecting a mechanical separation of the housing\\nand  a  lanyard  affixed  to  the  wearable  component,  the\\nlanyard having a predetermined length and mechanically\\nconnecting the wearable component to the housing, the\\nlanyard being mechanically separable from the housing\\nwhen  distance  between  the  wearable  component  and\\nthe housing exceeds the predetermined length. For ex-\\nample, the user input sensor 122 can determine that the\\nwearable component 120 has become detached, disen-\\ngaged, or otherwise physically separated from the con-\\ntroller 112.\\nIn some embodiments, detecting that the wear-\\n[0069]\\nable component has separated from the housing can in-\\nclude determining a signal strength of a wireless tether\\nsignal transmitted by a wireless transmitter of the wear-\\nable  component to  a wireless  receiver arranged within\\nthe housing  and  in  communication with the  separation\\nsensor, the signal strength being representative of a dis-\\ntance between the wearable component and the housing,\\nand determining that the signal strength is less than or\\nequal to a predetermined signal strength defining a pre-\\ndetermined separation distance. For example, the user\\nseparation sensor arrangement 118 can determine that\\nthe wearable component 120D has exceeded a threshold\\nseparation distance from the controller 112, or that a pe-\\nriodic  beacon  transmitted  by  the  wearable  component\\n120D has not been received for a predetermined length\\nof time.\\n[0070] At 3640, an alarm device is activated based on\\ndetecting  that  the  wearable  component  has  separated\\nfrom the housing. For example, the controller 112 of FIG.\\n7 can be activated. In some embodiments, activating the\\nalarm  device  can  include  transmitting  an  alarm  signal;\\nand wherein the process 3600 can also include receiving,\\nby mobile device, the alarm signal, and sending, by the\\nmobile device and in response to the receiving the alarm\\nsignal, a predetermined communication to one or more\\npredefined recipients. For example, the controller 112 of\\nFIG. 7 can activate the communication interface 134 to\\ncommunicate  with  the  mobile  phone  200.  The  mobile\\nphone 200 may have a software application installed and\\nexecuting thereupon,  and  the software application  can\\nbe  configured  to  react  to  the  communication  from  the\\nmobile accessory device 100E to cause the mobile phone\\nto communicate with one or more predetermined recipi-\\nents. For example, the software application may be con-\\nfigured to initiate a call, send a text message, email, me-\\ndia  file,  media  stream,  location  information  (e.g.,  GPS\\ndata), captured audio and/or video, or any other appro-\\npriate  information  to  one  or  more  contacts  previously\\nidentified by the user (e.g., family member, friend, neigh-\\nbor, doctor, nurse, caregiver, welfare official, emergency\\nservices, 911)\\nIn some embodiments, activating the alarm de-\\n[0071]\\nvice can include activating an audio output component\\n\\n\\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n\\ndisposed within the housing  and configured to emit an\\naudible alert when activated. For example, the controller\\n112 includes the audio output device 114 that can emit\\na siren, noise, prerecorded or synthesized spoken words\\nor other sounds, or any other appropriate sound that is\\nsufficiently loud enough to attract the attention of other\\nnearby persons and/or  repel an attacker.  In some em-\\nbodiments, activating the alarm device can include acti-\\nvating a visual output configured to emit an audible alert\\nwhen activated. For example, the controller 112 includes\\nthe light output device 116 that can emit a light or strobe\\nto  attract  the  attention  of  other  nearby  persons  and/or\\nrepel an attacker.\\nIn  some  embodiments, the  process 3600 can\\n[0072]\\ninclude removing the wearable component from a cavity\\ndefined  by  the  housing,  wherein  the  cavity  is  sized  to\\naccommodate storage of the wearable component. For\\nexample, FIGs. 22A-22F show that the example weara-\\nble component 1201 can be at least partly removed from\\nthe  mobile  accessory  device  1001  before  being  worn\\nabout the wrist of the user. In some embodiments, the\\nprocess 3600 can also include doffing the wearable com-\\nponent from the user, and stowing the wearable compo-\\nnent in a cavity defined by the housing, wherein the cavity\\nis sized to accommodate storage of the wearable com-\\nponent.  For  example,  the  process  illustrated  by  FIGs.\\n22A-22F can be reversed such that the user can take the\\nwearable component 1201 or 120L off his or her wrist,\\nand placed back in the groove 209 or 2909 defined in the\\nhousing of the mobile accessory device 1001 or 100L.\\n[0073] FIGs. 37a-45 illustrate various views of another\\nexample mobile accessory device 100M according to an\\nadditional  example  embodiment  of  the  present  disclo-\\nsure. The mobile accessory device 100M is configured\\nto be attached to the mobile phone 200, either directly or\\nindirectly, as will be discussed further below. The overall\\nconfiguration and features of the mobile accessory de-\\nvice 100M may be substantially similar to, or a subset of,\\nthat of the mobile accessory device 100 of FIG. 1. How-\\never, the mobile accessory device 100M of FIGS. 37a-\\n45 may vary in one or more respects.\\n[0074] The mobile accessory device 100M includes a\\nuser  input  sensor  having a  movable  component  144M\\n(e.g., a pull tab), which serves as a user input mechanism,\\nand is configured to activate when the movable compo-\\nnent 144M is at least partially moved, and an alarm device\\n(not shown) disposed in the housing 102M and config-\\nured to activate in response to activation of the user input\\nsensor. Activation of the alarm device can cause an au-\\ndible alarm, or cause a software application to be exe-\\ncuted  on  the  mobile  phone  200,  or  both.  The  audible\\nalarm can come either from an optional audio emitting\\ndevice disposed in the mobile accessory device 100M or\\n(e.g., in embodiments where the mobile accessory de-\\nvice  100M  does  not  include  an  audio  emitting  device)\\nfrom the mobile phone 200, e.g., using a speaker built\\ninto the mobile phone 200.\\n[0075] For example, as illustrated, the position of the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncomponents of the mobile accessory device 100M rela-\\ntive to a housing 102M may vary. A pull tab 144M is con-\\nfigured to remain in a stowed (e.g., un-extended) config-\\nuration  until  the  user  releases  the  pull  tab  144M  from\\nengagement with  the  housing 102M  or  moves  the  pull\\ntab 144M relative to the housing 102M. Releasing or mov-\\ning the pull tab 144M may activate one or more features.\\nFor  example,  in  response  to  the  pull  tab  144M  being\\nmoved, removed (at least in part), shifted, or released,\\nthe positioning system sensor 210 (see, FIG. 7) may be\\ninstructed  to  activate  via  the  communication  mecha-\\nnisms described above. Further, the user’s location may\\nbe  tracked,  e.g.,  using  GPS-like  functionality  built  into\\nthe mobile  phone 200, during  the time period  in which\\nthe pull tab 144M is released and thereby the user’s lo-\\ncation information may optionally be shared with one or\\nmore persons, if desired, e.g., using the communications\\ncapabilities of the mobile phone 200 (e.g., phone, email,\\nSMS text).\\n[0076] Further,  the  mobile  accessory  device  100M\\nmay include a slot 126M or a feature providing equivalent\\nfunctionality, positioned between the pull tab 144M and\\nthe housing 102M. In this regard, in some embodiments\\nthe user separation sensor arrangement may be activat-\\ned, for example, by engaging a fingernail or equivalent\\nin the slot 126M and moving the pull tab 144M. Thereby,\\nbased  on  user  input,  activation  of  the  user  separation\\nsensor arrangement may be conducted quickly (e.g., in\\nan unexpected dangerous situation), if necessary, for ex-\\nample, by moving (at least in part) the pull tab 144M.\\nIn  some  embodiments,  the  slot  126M,  which\\n[0077]\\nserves as a user input mechanism, may be supplement-\\ned or substituted with one or more other mechanical fea-\\ntures  configured  to  provide  frictional,  grippable,  or\\ngraspable surface or element to ease releasing or moving\\nthe pull tab 144M. Examples of such mechanical features\\ncan  include  raised  or  recessed  ribs,  dimples,  latches,\\nloops,  hooks,  projections,  textures  (e.g.,  rough,  soft,\\nsticky), or combinations of these or other mechanical fea-\\ntures  that  can  promote  manual  operation  (e.g.,  move-\\nment or removal) of the pull tab 144M.\\n[0078] Alternatively,  or  in  addition,  other  use  input\\nmechanisms (e.g., switches or buttons) may be used as\\na user input mechanism to trigger actuation of the mobile\\naccessory  device  100M.  In  one  such  embodiment,  a\\nswitch 128M (e.g., a button) is arranged on a lateral side\\n3710a of the housing 102M, substantially perpendicular\\nto  a  major  face  surface  3712.  Another  switch  129M  is\\narranged on a lateral side 3710b of the housing 102M,\\nsubstantially  perpendicular  to  the  major  face  surface\\n3712 opposite the switch 129M. The switch 128M and/or\\nthe switch 129M may be a depressible button, pressure\\nsensitive, or membrane switches defined as a fingertip-\\nsized recess or protrusion having a textured pattern (e.g.,\\nto  facilitate  identification  and  location  of  the  switch  by\\neither sight or touch). In use, the switch 128M and the\\nswitch 129M  are pressed  substantially simultaneously.\\nFor example, in the illustrated configuration, a user can\\n\\n\\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n\\nsqueeze the switch 128M and the switch 129M with two\\ndifferent fingers of one hand in order to activate an alarm,\\nthereby reducing a likelihood of false alarms due to ac-\\ncidental actuation of a single button. The switches may\\nbe  used  to  activate  an  alarm  though  a  predetermined\\ncontinuous press (e.g., three seconds), through a prede-\\ntermined series of presses (e.g., three presses within five\\nseconds),  or through  a  particular sequence  of presses\\n(e.g., first pressing the switch 128M and then the switch\\n129M), for  example, to reduce  the occurrence of acci-\\ndental activation.\\nIn  some  implementations,  the  switches  128M\\n[0079]\\nand  129M  may  activate  a  different  type  of  action  than\\nmay be triggered by separation of the pull tab 144M. For\\nexample,  the  mobile  accessory  device  100M  may  re-\\nspond to activation of the switches 128M and 129M by\\ninitiating a silent alarm to alert one or more predetermined\\nrecipients  (e.g.,  causing  the  mobile  phone  200  to  dis-\\ncretely send a message to a preselected contact), while\\nthe  mobile  accessory  device  100M  may  respond  to\\nmovement or partial removal of the pull tab 144M by in-\\nitiating an audible alarm and alerting one or more prede-\\ntermined recipients (e.g., set off a siren and send a mes-\\nsage or place a phone call to police). The audible alarm\\ncan come either from an optional audio emitting device\\ndisposed in the mobile accessory device 100M or (e.g.,\\nin  embodiments  where  the  mobile  accessory  device\\n100M does not  include  an  audio emitting  device)  from\\nthe mobile phone 200, e.g., using a speaker built into the\\nmobile phone 200.\\nIn some embodiments, the movable component\\n[0080]\\n(e.g.,  pull  tab  144M)  can  be  configured  to  be  at  least\\npartly moved relative to the housing 102M when subject-\\ned to a predetermined force. In some embodiments, the\\nmobile accessory device 100M can include a wearable\\ncomponent having a lanyard (e.g., the example wearable\\ncomponent 120) configured to mechanically attach to the\\nhousing 102M and/or the pull tab 144M and provide at\\nleast the predetermined force to the movable component\\nbased on a pull of upon the lanyard and at least partly\\nmove  the  movable  component  relative  to  the  housing\\n102M based on the pull.\\n[0081] FIG.  37b  shows  the  mobile  accessory  device\\n100M adhered or affixed to a companion mobile acces-\\nsory device 3701 (e.g., a wallet for holding identification\\ncards, credit cards, cash, or the like) which in turn is ad-\\nhered or affixed to the mobile phone 200. However, the\\nmobile accessory device 100M can be adhered or affixed\\ndirectly to the mobile phone 200 without the need for, or\\nuse of, the companion mobile accessory device 3701.\\n[0082] FIGs. 38-39 show the mobile accessory device\\n100M attached to the companion mobile accessory de-\\nvice 3701 without the mobile phone 200, whereas FIG.\\n40 shows the companion mobile accessory device 3701\\nalone.\\n[0083] FIGs. 41-43 show the mobile accessory device\\n100M  separate  from  the  companion  mobile  accessory\\ndevice  3701.  In some implementations, the  mobile ac-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncessory device 100M can engage (e.g., adhere to) a por-\\ntion of the mobile phone 200. In some implementations,\\nthe mobile accessory device 100M can engage a portion\\nof  a  companion  mobile  accessory  device  3701  (which\\nwill  be  discussed  further  in  the  description  of  FIGs.\\n44-45). In some embodiments, the mobile accessory de-\\nvice 100M and the companion mobile accessory device\\n3701 may be configured as two physically independent\\ncomponents that may be adhered or otherwise mechan-\\nically engaged to each other or may be used independ-\\nently. In some embodiments, the mobile accessory de-\\nvice 100M and the companion mobile accessory device\\n3701 may be configured as a combined unit (e.g., formed\\nas a monolithic, unitary assembly having a shared hous-\\ning).\\n[0084] Referring  now  to  FIG.  43,  a  rear  perspective\\nview of the mobile accessory device 100M is shown. A\\nmajor  face  4302  of  the  rear  side  of  the  housing  102M\\nincludes an adhesive pad 4301. In use, the adhesive pad\\n4301 can be contacted against (e.g., adhered to) a sur-\\nface of the mobile phone 200 (e.g., the rear surface 202),\\nor the surface 3702 of the companion mobile accessory\\ndevice 3701, or any other appropriate surface.\\n[0085] Referring now to FIGs. 40 and 45, rear perspec-\\ntive  views  of  the  companion  mobile  accessory  device\\n3701 is shown. A rear side 3703 of the companion mobile\\naccessory device 3701 includes an adhesive pad 4001.\\nIn use, the adhesive pad 4001 can be contacted against\\na surface of the mobile phone 200 (e.g., the rear surface\\n202), or any other appropriate surface.\\n[0086] Referring now primarily to FIGs. 36-40, 44, and\\n45,  the  companion  mobile  accessory  device  3701  is\\nshown. The companion mobile accessory device 3701\\nhas a housing that defines a cavity 4002. The cavity 4002\\nis  configured  to  removably  retain  one  or  more  wallet-\\nsized  cards  3704,  such  as  credit  cards,  identification\\ncards (e.g., driver’s license), loyalty cards, security ac-\\ncess cards, folded cash, or any other appropriately sized\\nitems.\\n[0087] FIG. 46 is a flow chart of an example process\\nfor using an example mobile accessory device. In some\\nimplementations,  the  process  4600  can  be  performed\\nusing one or more of the example mobile device acces-\\nsories 100A-100L of FIGs. 1-23, and 25-35, the personal\\nsafety device 300 of FIG. 23, and the mobile accessory\\ndevice 100M of FIGs. 37a-43.\\n[0088] At 4610, an attachment surface of a housing of\\na mobile accessory device is engaged to a mobile device.\\nFor example, the major face 4302 of the housing 102M\\nmay be configured to engage the rear surface 202 of the\\nmobile phone 200. In another example, the adhesive pad\\n4301 shown in FIG. 43 can be used to secure (e.g., ad-\\nhere) the mobile accessory device 100M to the compan-\\nion mobile accessory device 3701.\\n[0089] At 4620, a user input is received. For example,\\none or a combination of the switches 128M, 129M may\\nhave been pressed by a user. In another example, the\\npull tab 144M may have been actuated or partly removed\\n\\n\\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n\\nby a user.\\n[0090] At  4630,  a  separation  sensor  detects  that,\\nbased on the received user input, the mobile accessory\\ndevice 100M has been actuated. For example, the user\\ninput sensor 122 can determine that the pull tab 144M\\nhas been moved, removed (at least partially), released\\nor shifted, or that the switch 128M and/or the button 129M\\nhas been pressed.\\nIn  some  embodiments, the  process 4600 can\\n[0091]\\ninclude detecting a mechanical separation of the housing\\nand a lanyard affixed to a wearable component, the lan-\\nyard  having  a  predetermined  length  and  mechanically\\nconnecting the wearable component to the housing, the\\nlanyard being mechanically separable from the housing\\nwhen  distance  between  the  wearable  component  and\\nthe housing exceeds the predetermined length. For ex-\\nample, the pull tab 144M can be connected to the wear-\\nable component 120, and the user input sensor 122 can\\ndetermine that the wearable component 120 has caused\\nthe pull tab 144M to move or at be at least partly removed\\nfrom the housing 102M.\\n[0092] At 4640, an alarm device is activated based on\\ndetecting that the user input has been actuated. For ex-\\nample, the controller 112 of FIG. 7 can be activated. In\\nsome embodiments, activating the alarm device can in-\\nclude transmitting an alarm signal; and wherein the proc-\\ness 4600 can also include receiving, by mobile device,\\nthe alarm signal, and sending, by the mobile device and\\nin response to the receiving the alarm signal, a predeter-\\nmined communication to one or more predefined recipi-\\nents. For example, the controller 112 of FIG. 7 can acti-\\nvate the  communication interface 134 to  communicate\\nwith the mobile phone 200. The mobile phone 200 may\\nhave  a  software  application  installed  and  executing\\nthereupon, and the software application can be config-\\nured to react to the communication from the mobile ac-\\ncessory device 100M to cause the mobile phone to com-\\nmunicate  with  one  or  more  predetermined  recipients,\\nand/or to emit an audible alarm or other sound. For ex-\\nample, the software application may be configured to in-\\nitiate a call, send a text message, email, media file, media\\nstream, location information (e.g., GPS data), captured\\naudio and/or video, or any other appropriate information\\nto one or more contacts previously identified by the user\\n(e.g., family member, friend, neighbor, doctor, nurse, car-\\negiver,  welfare  official,  emergency  services,  911).  In\\nsome embodiments, the alarm device can be any appro-\\npriate circuit and/or mechanism that is configured for tak-\\ning a predetermined action in response to a trigger, and\\ndoes not necessarily require nor preclude that the alarm\\ndevice is itself capable of generating an audible alarm.\\nIn some embodiments, activating the alarm de-\\n[0093]\\nvice can include activating an audio output component\\ndisposed within the housing  and configured to emit an\\naudible  alert  when  activated.  For  example,  the  mobile\\naccessory device 100M can include the audio output de-\\nvice 114 that can emit a siren, noise, prerecorded or syn-\\nthesized spoken words or other sounds, or any other ap-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npropriate sound that is sufficiently loud enough to attract\\nthe  attention  of  other  nearby  persons  and/or  repel  an\\nattacker. In some embodiments, activating the alarm de-\\nvice can include activating a visual output configured to\\nemit an audible alert when activated. For example, the\\nmobile accessory device 100M can include the light out-\\nput device 116 that can emit a light or strobe to attract\\nthe  attention  of  other  nearby  persons  and/or  repel  an\\nattacker.\\nIn another configuration, the mobile accessory\\n[0094]\\ndevice need not be configured to be physically attachable\\nto the mobile device, but rather may be implemented as\\na standalone unit that can be carried or worn by a user\\n(e.g., as a wallet attachment or insert, key fob, bracelet,\\nor the like), and which maintains a wireless communica-\\ntion connection between the accessory and the mobile\\ndevice. In this configuration, other than the lack of phys-\\nical attachment, the accessory can be designed and im-\\nplemented to have any or all of the same features and/or\\nfunctionality as the configuration in which the accessory\\nis designed to be attached to the mobile device, as de-\\nscribed above.\\n[0095] FIGs. 47-49B illustrate various views of a mobile\\naccessory device 100N according to an additional exam-\\nple  embodiment  of  the  present  disclosure.  The  mobile\\naccessory device 100N is configured to be attached to\\nthe mobile phone 200, either directly or indirectly, as will\\nbe discussed further below. The overall configuration and\\nfeatures of the  mobile accessory device 100N may be\\nsubstantially similar to, or a subset of, that of the mobile\\naccessory  device  100  of  FIG.  1.  However,  the  mobile\\naccessory device 100N of FIGS. 47-49B may vary in one\\nor more respects.\\n[0096] The mobile accessory device 100N includes a\\nhousing 102N and a user input sensor having a movable\\ncomponent 4744 (e.g., a sliding switch, a pull tab, a trig-\\nger component),  which  serves  as  a user input mecha-\\nnism,  and  is  configured  to  activate  when  the  movable\\ncomponent 4744 is at least partially moved relative to the\\nhousing 102N, and controller (e.g., the controller 112 of\\nFIG. 7, not shown here) disposed in the housing 102N\\nand  configured  to  activate  in  response  to  activation  of\\nthe  user  input  sensor.  Activation  of  the  controller  can\\ncause an audible alarm, or cause a software application\\nto be executed on the mobile phone 200, or both. The\\naudible  alarm  can  come  either  from  an  optional  audio\\nemitting device disposed in the mobile accessory device\\n100N or (e.g., in embodiments where the mobile acces-\\nsory device 100N does not include an audio emitting de-\\nvice) from the mobile phone 200, e.g., using a speaker\\nbuilt into the mobile phone 200.\\n[0097] For example, as illustrated, the position of the\\ncomponents of the mobile accessory device 100N rela-\\ntive to a housing 102N may vary. The movable compo-\\nnent 4744 is configured to remain in a stowed (e.g., un-\\nextended) configuration until the user slide the movable\\ncomponent 4744 away from the stowed configuration rel-\\native to the housing 102N. Moving or releasing the mov-\\n\\n\\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n\\nable component 4744 may activate one or more features.\\nFor  example,  in  response  to  the  movable  component\\n4744 being moved, removed (at least in part), shifted, or\\nreleased,  the  position  location  detector  system  154  or\\n210 (see, FIG. 7) may be instructed to activate via the\\ncommunication mechanisms described above. Further,\\nthe user’s location may be tracked, e.g., using GPS-like\\nfunctionality built into the mobile accessory device 100N\\nor the mobile phone 200, during the time period in which\\nthe movable component 4744 is out of its default position\\nand thereby the user’s location information may option-\\nally be shared with one or more persons, if desired, e.g.,\\nusing  the  communications  capabilities  of  the  mobile\\nphone 200 or the mobile accessory device 100N (e.g.,\\nphone, email, SMS text).\\n[0098] Further, the mobile accessory device 100N may\\ninclude a slot 4726, a recess, a depression, a textured\\narea,  or  a  feature  providing  equivalent  functionality  to\\nease movement of the moveable component 4744, po-\\nsitioned between the movable component 4744 and the\\nhousing 102N. In this regard, in some embodiments the\\nuser input sensor arrangement may be activated, for ex-\\nample, by engaging a fingertip or fingernail or equivalent\\nin  the  slot  4726  and  moving  the  movable  component\\n4744.  Thereby,  based  on  user  input,  activation  of  the\\nuser separation sensor arrangement may be conducted\\nquickly  (e.g., in an unexpected  dangerous situation),  if\\nnecessary, for example, by moving (at least in part) the\\nmovable component 4744.\\nIn some embodiments, the movable component\\n[0099]\\n4744, which serves as a user input mechanism, may be\\nsupplemented or substituted with one or more other me-\\nchanical features configured to provide frictional, grippa-\\nble, or graspable surface or element to ease releasing\\nor  moving  the movable component 4744. Examples of\\nsuch mechanical features can include raised or recessed\\nribs, dimples, latches, loops, hooks, projections, textures\\n(e.g., rough, soft, sticky), or combinations of these or oth-\\ner mechanical features that can promote manual opera-\\ntion (e.g., movement or removal) of the movable compo-\\nnent 4744.\\n[0100] Alternatively,  or  in  addition,  other  user  input\\nmechanisms (e.g., switches or buttons) may be used as\\na user input mechanism to trigger actuation of the mobile\\naccessory  device  100N.  In  one  such  embodiment,  a\\nswitch 128N (e.g., a button) is arranged on a lateral side\\n4710a of the housing 102N, substantially perpendicular\\nto  a  major  face  surface  4712.  Another  switch  129N  is\\narranged on a lateral side 4710b of the housing 102N,\\nsubstantially  perpendicular  to  the  major  face  surface\\n4712 opposite the switch 129N. The switch 128N and/or\\nthe switch 129N may be a depressible button, pressure\\nsensitive, or membrane switches defined as a fingertip-\\nsized recess or protrusion having a textured pattern (e.g.,\\nto  facilitate  identification  and  location  of  the  switch  by\\neither sight or touch).  In use, the  switch 128N  and the\\nswitch  129N  are  pressed  substantially  simultaneously.\\nFor example, in the illustrated configuration, a user can\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsqueeze the switch 128N and the switch 129N with two\\ndifferent fingers of one hand in order to activate an alarm,\\nthereby reducing a likelihood of false alarms due to ac-\\ncidental actuation of a single button. The switches may\\nbe used to activate an alarm or non-alarm function though\\na predetermined continuous press (e.g., three seconds),\\nthrough a predetermined  series of presses (e.g.,  three\\npresses within five seconds), or through a particular se-\\nquence of presses (e.g., first pressing the switch 128N\\nand then the switch 129N), for example, to reduce the\\noccurrence  of  accidental  activation.  In  some  embodi-\\nments, the user input mechanism can be configured to\\ndifferentiate  between  and  respond  to  multiple  different\\nuser inputs. For example, the user can use one prede-\\ntermined  combination  of buttons and press patterns  to\\nactivate one  response,  and  can  use  another  predeter-\\nmined combination to active another response. In a more\\nspecific  example, one press the  switch 128N could be\\nused  to  activate  a  texting  application  on  the  mobile\\nphone, two presses could be used to activate a camera\\napp  on  the  mobile  phone,  and  three  presses  could  be\\nused to activate one or more of the alarm functions.\\n[0101] Alternatively,  or  in  addition,  other  user  input\\nmechanisms (e.g., microphones, audio sensors) may be\\nused as a user input mechanism to trigger actuation of\\nthe mobile accessory device 100N. In one such embod-\\niment, the mobile accessory device 100N can include a\\nmicrophone and sound detector circuit (e.g., the sound\\ndetector arrangement 150 and the microphone 152). The\\nsound detector circuit can be  configured to respond  to\\npredetermined sounds or sound patterns as a user input\\n(e.g.,  voice  commands,  shouts,  alarms,  horns,  sirens,\\nbeeps, bells). In some implementations, the sound de-\\ntector  circuit  can  respond  to  sounds  as  user  inputs by\\ntriggering its internal  alarm  functions,  by  triggering  an-\\nother device (e.g., activating an application on a mobile\\nphone  to  send  a  message  for  help,  causing  a  mobile\\nphone to emit an audible or visual alarm), or by triggering\\nan existing function of another device (e.g., activating a\\nvoice assistant or other voice-responsive feature of a mo-\\nbile phone or other device in communication with the mo-\\nbile accessory device 100N).\\nIn  some  implementations,  the  switches  128N\\n[0102]\\nand  129N  may  activate  a  different  type  of  action  than\\nmay be triggered by separation of the movable compo-\\nnent  4744.  For  example,  the  mobile  accessory  device\\n100N  may  respond  to  activation  of  the  switches  128N\\nand 129N by initiating a silent alarm to alert one or more\\npredetermined recipients (e.g., causing the mobile phone\\n200 to discretely send a message to a preselected con-\\ntact), while the mobile accessory device 100N may re-\\nspond  to  movement  or  partial  removal  of  the  movable\\ncomponent 4744 by initiating an audible alarm and alert-\\ning one or more predetermined recipients (e.g., set off a\\nsiren and send a message or place a phone call to police).\\nThe audible alarm can come either from an optional audio\\nemitting device disposed in the mobile accessory device\\n100N or (e.g., in embodiments where the mobile acces-\\n\\n\\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n\\nsory device 100N does not include an audio emitting de-\\nvice) from the mobile phone 200, e.g., using a speaker\\nbuilt into the mobile phone 200.\\nIn some embodiments, the movable component\\n[0103]\\n4744 (e.g., pull tab) can be configured to be at least partly\\nmoved relative to the housing 102N when subjected to\\na predetermined force. In some embodiments, the mobile\\naccessory device 100N can include a wearable compo-\\nnent having a lanyard (e.g., the example wearable com-\\nponent  120)  configured  to  mechanically  attach  to  the\\nhousing 102N and/or the movable component 4744 and\\nprovide at least the predetermined force to the movable\\ncomponent based on a pull of upon the lanyard and at\\nleast partly move the movable component relative to the\\nhousing 102N based on the pull.\\n[0104] The mobile accessory device 100N has a rear\\nsurface 4702 substantially parallel to the major face sur-\\nface 4712. In the illustrated example, an adhesive pad\\n4810 is affixed to the rear surface 4702. In use, the ad-\\nhesive pad 4801 can be pressed against another surface\\n(e.g.,  the  rear  of  the  mobile  phone  200)  to  attach  the\\nmobile accessory device 100N to the other surface.\\n[0105] FIGs. 49A and 49B illustrate a sectional view of\\nthe example mobile accessory device 100N of FIG. 47.\\nThese views are provided to show the configuration and\\noperation of the movable component 4744 relative to the\\nhousing 102N.\\n[0106] FIG. 49A shows  the mobile accessory device\\n100N in a first configuration (e.g., a triggered configura-\\ntion).  The  movable  component  4744  is  configured  to\\nmove linearly along the slot 4726. FIG. 49B shows the\\nmobile accessory device 100N in a second configuration\\n(e.g., a default, un-triggered configuration). The movable\\ncomponent 4744 can be slid along the slot 4726 (e.g.,\\ninward, toward the center of the housing 102N) to change\\nthe movable component 4744 from the first configuration\\nto the second configuration, and the movable component\\n4744 can be slid along the slot 4726 (e.g., outward, away\\nfrom the center of the housing 102N) to change the mov-\\nable component 4744 from the second configuration to\\nthe first configuration (e.g., to trigger an alarm function).\\nAs  the  movable  component  4744  is  actuated  between\\nthe two configurations, the movable component 4744 ac-\\ntivates and releases a switch 4901 (e.g., as part of the\\nuser input sensor 122).\\n[0107] FIG.  50  illustrates  a  perspective  from  view  of\\nthe example mobile accessory device 100N of FIGs. 47\\nand 49B an example companion mobile accessory de-\\nvice 5000. FIG. 51 illustrates a perspective rear view of\\nthe  example  mobile  accessory  device  100N  and  com-\\npanion mobile accessory device 5000. FIGs. 50 and 51\\nshows the mobile accessory device 100N adhered or af-\\nfixed  to  the  companion  mobile  accessory  device  5000\\n(e.g., a wallet for holding identification cards, credit cards,\\ncash, or the like). In some embodiments, the companion\\nmobile accessory device 5000 can, in turn, be adhered,\\naffixed, or otherwise coupled to the mobile phone 200.\\n[0108] Referring now to FIG. 51. A rear side 5002 of\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe companion mobile accessory device 5000 includes\\nan adhesive pad 5001. In use, the adhesive pad 5001\\ncan be contacted against a surface of the mobile phone\\n200 (e.g., the rear surface 202), or any other appropriate\\nsurface. The companion mobile accessory device 5000\\ndefines a cavity 5003. The cavity 5003 is configured to\\nremovably retain one or more wallet-sized cards 5004,\\nsuch  as  credit  cards, identification  cards  (e.g.,  driver’s\\nlicense),  loyalty  cards,  security  access  cards,  folded\\ncash, or any other appropriately sized items.\\n[0109] FIG. 52 illustrates a partially exploded perspec-\\ntive side view of the example mobile accessory device\\n100N and the companion mobile accessory device 5000.\\nIn the illustrated example, the companion mobile acces-\\nsory device 5000 includes a collection of pins 5201 and\\ntabs  5202,  and  the  mobile  accessory  device  100N  in-\\ncludes a corresponding collection of bores 5203 and slots\\n5204. The pins 5201 and the bores 5203, and the tabs\\n5202 and the slots 5204 are configured to matingly en-\\ngage to mechanically affix the companion mobile acces-\\nsory device 5000 to the mobile accessory device 100N.\\n[0110] FIGs.  53  and  54 illustrate an  example  mobile\\naccessory  device  5300  having  magnetic  features.  In\\nsome embodiments, the mobile accessory device 5300\\ncan be a modification of the example mobile accessory\\ndevice 100N of FIGs. 47-49B, or the combination of the\\nmobile  accessory  device  100N  and  the  example  com-\\npanion  mobile  accessory  device  5000  device  of  FIGs.\\n50-52.\\n[0111] The mobile accessory device 5300 includes a\\nhousing 5302, and the housing 5302 includes an attach-\\nment component 5310 that is configured to magnetically\\nengage  corresponding  magnetic  features  provided  on\\nthe rear surface 202 of the mobile phone 200. In some\\nembodiments, the attachment component 5310 can be\\nmade of a magnet, a collection of magnets, a magnetic\\nmaterial, or combination of these and any other appro-\\npriate  passively  or  actively  magnetic  components  that\\ncan  magnetically  couple  the  mobile  accessory  device\\n5300 to the mobile phone 200.\\nIn  some  embodiments,  the  mobile  accessory\\n[0112]\\ndevice  5300  can  include  sensors  that  can  determine\\nwhether or not the mobile accessory device 5300 is at-\\ntached, coupled, or otherwise substantially abutted to the\\nmobile phone 200. For example, the mobile accessory\\ndevice 5300 can include a switch (e.g., a momentary pin\\nswitch  that  is  kept  depressed  by  contact  between  the\\nmobile accessory device 5300 and the rear surface 202\\nand released when the two become separated), a phot-\\nonic sensor (e.g., an illuminator and a photodetector that\\ncan detect  the presence  or  absence  of illumination re-\\nflected off the rear surface  202), or  a magnetic  sensor\\n(e.g., a Hall sensor or reed switch in the mobile accessory\\ndevice 5300 that is configured to be activated when mo-\\nbile accessory device 5300 is moved too far away from\\nthe magnetic features provided on the rear surface 202).\\nIn  some  embodiments,  the  mobile  accessory  device\\n5300 can include a wearable component such as a tether\\n\\n\\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n\\nor a lanyard (e.g., the example wearable component 120)\\nconfigured to  mechanically attach  to the  housing 5302\\nand provide at least a predetermined force to the housing\\n5302  based on a pull of  upon the  lanyard  and  at least\\npartly separate the mobile accessory device 5300 from\\nthe mobile phone 200 based on the pull.\\n[0113] FIG.s  55A  and  55B  illustrate  perspective  and\\nside views of an example of a mobile accessory device\\nbutton 5500 according to an additional example embod-\\niment of the present disclosure. The mobile accessory\\ndevice button  5500 is configured to be attached to the\\nmobile phone 200, either directly or indirectly, as will be\\ndiscussed further  below. The overall configuration and\\nfeatures of the mobile accessory device button 5500 may\\nbe substantially similar to, or a subset of, that of the mo-\\nbile accessory device 100 of FIG. 1. However, the mobile\\naccessory device button 5500 may vary in one or more\\nrespects.\\n[0114] The  mobile  accessory  device  button  5500  in-\\ncludes a housing 5502 and a button 5504 that serves as\\na  user  input  mechanism,  and  is  configured  to  activate\\nwhen the button 5504 is at least partially moved relative\\nto the housing 5502, and controller (e.g., the controller\\n112 of FIG. 7, not shown here) disposed in the housing\\n5502 and configured to activate in response to activation\\nof the user input sensor. In the illustrated example, the\\nhousing 5502 and the button 5504 are configured with a\\ngenerally convex (e.g., domed) shape.\\n[0115] Activation of the controller can cause an audible\\nalarm, or cause a software application to be executed on\\nthe mobile phone  200,  or both. The audible alarm can\\ncome either from an optional audio emitting device dis-\\nposed  in  the  mobile  accessory  device  button  5500  or\\n(e.g., in embodiments where the mobile accessory de-\\nvice button 5500 does not include an audio emitting de-\\nvice) from the mobile phone 200, e.g., using a speaker\\nbuilt into the mobile phone 200. Alternatively, or in addi-\\ntion,  other  user  input  mechanisms  (e.g.,  microphones,\\naudio sensors) may be used as a user input mechanism\\nto trigger actuation of the mobile accessory device button\\n5500.\\n[0116] A rear side 5506 of the mobile accessory device\\nbutton 5500 includes an adhesive pad 5508. In use, the\\nadhesive pad 5001 can be contacted against a surface\\nof the mobile phone 200 (e.g., the rear surface 202), or\\nany other appropriate surface. For example, the mobile\\naccessory device button 5500 can be affixed, engaged,\\nadhered, or other otherwise coupled atop a one-handed\\nphone holder that is attached to the mobile phone 200.\\nIn some embodiments, the mobile accessory device but-\\nton  5500  can  include  magnetic,  adhesive,  and/or  me-\\nchanical features to enable attachment, adherence, af-\\nfixment, engagement, and/or coupling of the mobile ac-\\ncessory device button 5500, directly or indirectly, to the\\nmobile phone 200.\\n[0117] FIG.s  56A  and  56B  illustrate  perspective  and\\nside views of an example of a mobile accessory device\\nbutton 5600 according to an additional example embod-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\niment of the present  disclosure.

The  overall  configuration and\\nfeatures of the mobile accessory device button 5600 may\\nbe substantially similar to, or a subset of, that of the mo-\\nbile accessory device 100 of FIG. 1. However, the mobile\\naccessory device button 5600 may vary in one or more\\nrespects.\\n[0118] The  mobile  accessory  device  button  5600  in-\\ncludes a housing 5602 and a button 5604 that serves as\\na  user  input  mechanism,  and  is  configured  to  activate\\nwhen the button 5604 is at least partially moved relative\\nto the housing 5602, and controller (e.g., the controller\\n112 of FIG. 7, not shown here) disposed in the housing\\n5602 and configured to activate in response to activation\\nof the user input sensor. In the illustrated example, the\\nhousing 5602 and the button 5604 are configured with a\\ngenerally concave (e.g., scalloped, indented, recessed)\\nshape.\\n[0119] Activation of the controller can cause an audible\\nalarm, or cause a software application to be executed on\\nthe mobile  phone 200, or both.  The audible  alarm  can\\ncome either from an optional audio emitting device dis-\\nposed  in  the  mobile  accessory  device  button  5600  or\\n(e.g., in embodiments where the mobile accessory de-\\nvice button 5600 does not include an audio emitting de-\\nvice) from the mobile phone 200, e.g., using a speaker\\nbuilt into the mobile phone 200. Alternatively, or in addi-\\ntion,  other  user  input  mechanisms  (e.g.,  microphones,\\naudio sensors) may be used as a user input mechanism\\nto trigger actuation of the mobile accessory device button\\n5600.\\n[0120] A rear side 5606 of the mobile accessory device\\nbutton 5600 includes an adhesive pad 5608. In use, the\\nadhesive pad 5001 can be contacted against a surface\\nof the mobile phone 200 (e.g., the rear surface 202), or\\nany other appropriate surface. For example, the mobile\\naccessory device button 5600 can be affixed, engaged,\\nadhered, or other otherwise coupled atop a one-handed\\nphone holder that is attached to the mobile phone 200.\\nIn some embodiments, the mobile accessory device but-\\nton  5600  can  include  magnetic,  adhesive,  and/or  me-\\nchanical features to enable attachment, adherence, af-\\nfixment, engagement, and/or coupling of the mobile ac-\\ncessory device button 5600, directly or indirectly, to the\\nmobile phone 200.\\n[0121] FIG. 57 is a flow chart of an example process\\n5700  using  an  example  mobile  accessory  device.  In\\nsome  implementations,  the  process  5700  can  be  per-\\nformed using one or more of the example mobile device\\naccessories 100A-100N an5 5300-5600  of FIGs.  1-23,\\nand  25-35,  the  personal  safety  device  300  of  FIG.  23,\\nthe mobile accessory device 100M of FIGs. 37a-43, the\\nmobile accessory device 100N of FIGs. 47-52, the mobile\\naccessory device 5300 of FIGs. 53-54, and the mobile\\naccessory device buttons 5500 and 5600 of FIG.s 55A-\\n56B.\\n\\n\\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n\\n[0122] At an option step 5710, an attachment surface\\nof a housing of a mobile accessory device is engaged to\\na mobile device. For example, the surface 4801 of the\\nhousing 102N may be configured to engage the rear sur-\\nface 202 of the mobile phone 200. In another example,\\nthe attachment component 5310 shown in FIG. 53 can\\nbe used to secure (e.g., magnetically couple) the mobile\\naccessory device 5300 to the mobile phone 200.\\n[0123] At 5720, a user input of the mobile accessory\\ndevice is received. For example, one or a combination\\nor a pattern of the switches 128N, 129N may have been\\npressed by a user. In another example, the movable com-\\nponent 4744 may have been actuated or partly moved\\nby a user. In another example, the button 5504 may be\\npressed by a user.\\n[0124] At 5730, a user input sensor detects that, based\\non the received user input, the mobile accessory device\\nhas been actuated. For example, the user input sensor\\n122  can  determine  that  the  movable  component  4744\\nhas been moved, removed (at least partially), released,\\nor shifted, or that the switch 128N and/or the button 129N\\nhas been pressed.\\nIn  some  embodiments, the  process 5700 can\\n[0125]\\ninclude detecting a mechanical separation of the housing\\nand a lanyard affixed to a wearable component, the lan-\\nyard  having  a  predetermined  length  and  mechanically\\nconnecting the wearable component to the housing, the\\nlanyard being mechanically separable from the housing\\nwhen  distance  between  the  wearable  component  and\\nthe housing exceeds the predetermined length. For ex-\\nample, the movable component 4744 can be connected\\nto the wearable component 120, and the user input sen-\\nsor 122 can determine that the wearable component 120\\nhas caused the movable component 4744 to move or at\\nbe at least partly removed from the housing 102N.\\n[0126] At  5740,  a  device  function  is  activated based\\non detecting that the user input has been actuated. For\\nexample, the controller 112 of FIG. 7 can be activated.\\nIn some embodiments, activating the device function can\\ninclude  transmitting  an  alarm  signal;  and  wherein  the\\nprocess 5700 can also include receiving, by mobile de-\\nvice, the alarm signal, and sending, by the mobile device\\nand in response to the receiving the alarm signal, a pre-\\ndetermined  communication  to  one  or  more  predefined\\nrecipients. For example, the controller 112 of FIG. 7 can\\nactivate  the communication interface 134 to communi-\\ncate with the mobile phone 200. The mobile phone 200\\nmay have a software application installed and executing\\nthereupon, and the software application can be config-\\nured to react to the communication from the mobile ac-\\ncessory device 100M to cause the mobile phone to com-\\nmunicate  with  one  or  more  predetermined  recipients,\\nand/or to emit an audible alarm or other sound. For ex-\\nample, the software application may be configured to in-\\nitiate a call, send a text message, email, media file, media\\nstream, location information (e.g., GPS data), captured\\naudio and/or video, or any other appropriate information\\nto one or more contacts previously identified by the user\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(e.g., family member, friend, neighbor, doctor, nurse, car-\\negiver,  welfare  official,  emergency  services,  911).  In\\nsome embodiments, the device function can be any ap-\\npropriate circuit and/or mechanism that is configured for\\ntaking a predetermined action in response to a trigger,\\nand does not necessarily require nor preclude that the\\nalarm  device is  itself capable  of  generating an audible\\nalarm.\\nIn  some  embodiments,  activating  the  device\\n[0127]\\nfunction can include activating an audio output compo-\\nnent disposed within the housing and configured to emit\\nan audible alert when activated. For example, the mobile\\naccessory device 100N can include the audio output de-\\nvice 114 that can emit a siren, noise, prerecorded or syn-\\nthesized spoken words or other sounds, or any other ap-\\npropriate sound that is sufficiently loud enough to attract\\nthe  attention  of  other  nearby  persons  and/or  repel  an\\nattacker. In some embodiments, activating the alarm de-\\nvice can include activating a visual output configured to\\nemit an audible alert when activated. For example, the\\nmobile accessory device 100N can include the light out-\\nput device 116 that can emit a light or strobe to attract\\nthe  attention  of  other  nearby  persons  and/or  repel  an\\nattacker.\\nIn  some  embodiments,  activating  the  device\\n[0128]\\nfunction can include  activating a  non-alarm  function  of\\nthe  device.  For  example,  the  mobile  accessory  device\\n100N can be configured to respond to activation by com-\\nmunicating with the mobile phone 200. The mobile device\\ncan be configured (e.g., with an application executing on\\nthe mobile phone 200) to receive the communication and\\nrespond by activating a function of the mobile phone 200\\n(e.g., opening an app, taking a photo, triggering an alarm,\\nactivating  a  voice  assistant  into  a  standby  or  listening\\nmode).\\nIn another configuration, the mobile accessory\\n[0129]\\ndevice need not be configured to be physically attachable\\nto the mobile device, but rather may be implemented as\\na standalone unit that can be carried or worn by a user\\n(e.g., as a wallet attachment or insert, key fob, bracelet,\\nor the like), and which maintains a wireless communica-\\ntion connection between the accessory and the mobile\\ndevice. In this configuration, other than the lack of phys-\\nical attachment, the accessory can be designed and im-\\nplemented to have any or all of the same features and/or\\nfunctionality as the configuration in which the accessory\\nis designed to be attached to the mobile device, as de-\\nscribed above.\\n[0130] Although a few implementations have been de-\\nscribed in detail above, other modifications are possible.\\nFor example, the logic flows depicted in the figures do\\nnot require the particular order shown, or sequential or-\\nder, to achieve desirable results. In addition, other steps\\nmay be provided, or steps may be eliminated, from the\\ndescribed flows, and other components may be added\\nto, or removed from, the described systems. Accordingly,\\nother implementations are within the scope of the follow-\\ning claim.\\n\\n\\n\\nEP 4 054 160 A1\\n\\n\\nEMBODIMENTS:\\n\\n[0131] Although the present invention is defined in the\\nclaims, it should be understood that the present invention\\ncan also (alternatively) be defined in accordance with the\\nfollowing embodiments:\\n\\n1.

systems  and  techniques for providing personal protection in the form of an', 'EP 4 054 160 A1', 'alarm accessory for a mobile device. In general, a mobiledevice,  e.g.,  a  cellular  telephone  (phone)  or  a  mobilephone, can be modified (e.g., attached to an accessoryand/or  through  the  use  of  specialized  software  on  themobile device), to respond to one or more predeterminedconditions to automatically, and/or with user interaction,trigger an alarm and thereby draw attention to that person’s present circumstances in order to seek help and/orscare away a potential threat. Accordingly, this documentdescribes, among other things, an accessory that can beattached  to  the  mobile  device  and  provide  enhancedsafety functionality to a user of the mobile device. Variousconfigurations of such a mobile accessory device and itsuse are described herein, and may include various combinations  of  the  following  features  and/or  functionality.The accessory may be embodied in many different formsand should not be construed as limited to the implementations set forth herein. As used in the specification, andin the appended claims, the singular forms \"a\", \"an\", \"the\",include plural variations unless the  context clearly  dictates otherwise.[0015] As illustrated in FIGS. 1-6, the present disclosure relates to a mobile accessory device 100, also referred to a mobile accessory device. The mobile accessory device 100 may be configured for use with a mobiledevice such as a mobile phone 200 or other mobile device(e.g., tablet computer, notebook computer, etc.). In particular, the mobile accessory device 100 may be configured to engage (e.g., adhere to or otherwise be physicallyjoined to) the mobile phone 200. The mobile accessorydevice 100 may be configured to engage any portion ofthe mobile phone 200, such as  the rear surface of thehousing of the mobile phone 200. In some embodiments,the mobile accessory device 100 may be a stand-alonedevice that does not physically engage to a mobile device.In  one  implementation,  the  mobile  accessory[0016]device 100 may include a housing 102. The housing 102may  define  an  attachment  (e.g.,  locking)  surface  104(see, FIG. 2) and an outer surface 106 (see, e.g., FIG.1). As illustrated in FIG. 2, the attachment surface 104may be configured to engage a rear surface 202 of themobile phone 200 opposite from a front surface 204 atwhich  a  display  is  positioned.  Thereby,  the  mobile  accessory  device  100  does  not  block  the  display  in  thisconfiguration. Further, the mobile accessory device 100may occupy less than an entirety of an area of the rearsurface 202 of the mobile phone 200. Thereby, the mobileaccessory device 100 may not block any rear-facing camera thereon. Further, by providing the mobile accessorydevice 100 with a relatively small size, the mobile accessory  may  be  attached  to  mobile  phones  with  differingsizes and shapes. Further, the mobile accessory device100 may be configured to not extend to the edges of themobile  phone  200,  such  that  an  edge  protecting  casemay be employed with the mobile phone. As may be understood, the mobile accessory may also be configuredto engage a case for the mobile phone that includes a', 'rear portion that covers the rear surface (see, e.g., FIGS.21 and 22). In another embodiment, the mobile accessory  may  itself  comprise  a  case  for  the  mobile  phone(see, e.g., FIG. 11).[0017] The attachment surface 104 of the housing 102may be configured to substantially permanently engagethe rear surface 202 of the mobile phone 200, or a casepositioned at the rear  surface  as noted above.  For example, the mobile accessory device 100 may include anadhesive  at  the  attachment  surface  104  configured  toadhere to the rear surface 202 of the mobile phone 200.Thereby, the mobile accessory device 100 may be configured for use over the lifetime of the mobile phone 200,thereby ensuring that the mobile accessory is availableat all times the mobile phone is in the user’s possession.Alternatively, the attachment surface 104 of the housing102 may be configured to releasably engage (e.g., usinga slot-tab arrangement, or hook and loop connecting surfaces  such  as  VELCRO®)  the  rear  surface  202  of  themobile phone 200, or a case positioned at the rear surface as noted above.[0018] As  illustrated  in  FIG.  4,  the  mobile  accessorydevice 100 may include a power source 108, which maybe a battery. Further, the housing 102 may include a battery portion 110 that is configured to receive the powersource 108. The battery portion 110 may be removableto allow for replacement of the power source 108. Thepower source 108 may be configured to provide electricalpower to each of the components of the mobile accessorydevice 100 such that the mobile accessory is self-powered. However, as may be understood, in another implementation  the  mobile  accessory  may  be  configured  toreceive electrical power from the mobile phone. For example,  the  mobile  accessory  may  include  a connectorthat engages a power port or a headphone jack on themobile phone. Alternatively, or in addition, the mobile accessory may draw power from the phone wirelessly viaa technique akin to QI® inductive charging, but in reverse(e.g., reverse wireless charging, wireless power sharing).[0019] Additional  control  circuitry  components  of  themobile accessory device 100 and the mobile phone 200are schematically illustrated in FIG. 7. As illustrated, themobile accessory device 100 includes a controller 112,which may be at least partially received in the housing102. The controller 112 is in communication with the mobile  phone  200  (e.g.,  a  communications  connection,BLUETOOTH, USB) for providing signals to the mobilephone 200, for example, to request, trigger, command,or otherwise control operation of at least some operationor actions of the mobile phone 200. The controller 112may include an audio output device 114 such as a speaker and a light output device 116 such as a light emittingdiode (LED) or xenon strobe. Example positions and configurations of the audio output device 114 and the lightoutput device 116 are illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 3-6.[0020] As further illustrated in FIG. 7, the control circuitry of the mobile accessory device 100 includes a userseparation sensor arrangement 118 (e.g., proximity de-', 'EP 4 054 160 A1', 'tector).  The  user  separation  sensor  arrangement  118may  include  a  wearable  component  120  configured  toengage  (e.g.,  donned  by,  worn  by)  a  user  and  a  userinput sensor 122 (e.g., a user input apparatus) engagedwith the housing 102 and in communication with the controller 112. The controller 112 may be configured to activate and/or perform one or more predetermined operations in response to the user input sensor 122’s determining  that  the  wearable  component  120  exceeds  athreshold separation distance therefrom, and/or has become detached (e.g., mechanically separated) from themobile  accessory device  100, e.g.,  providing  an  alarmsignal to indicate that separation between the mobile accessory  device  100  and  the  wearable  component  120has occurred, in response to which one or more actionscan occur-e.g., sounding an audible alarm on the accessory, emitting light from a light source on the accessory,cause the attached phone’s flash light to turn on or strobe,cause the attached phone to transmit a message via textand/or phone call, cause the mobile phone to emit sound,cause the mobile phone to take photos or begin recordingvideo,  either  through the forward-facing  camera or therearward-facing  camera  or  the  both,  or  otherwise  anyoperation  within  the  attached  phone’s  functionalities.Note that any phone-based action could be achieved bythe accessory’s transmitting to the mobile phone that analarm condition has been detected, e.g., in response tothe user’s pushing a button on the accessory, or in response to the proximity between the accessory and thewearable component being exceeded and/or in responseto the wearable component being mechanically disconnected from the accessory.[0021] As further illustrated in FIG. 7, the control circuitry  of  the  mobile  accessory  device  100  includes  asound detector arrangement 150 (e.g., a sound detectioncircuit). The sound  detector arrangement 150 includescircuitry that is configured to receive sound signals froma  microphone  152  and  identify  one  or  more  predetermined sounds. The controller 112 is configured to provideone or  more  predetermined actions  in response  to theidentification  of  one  or  more  corresponding sounds. Insome implementations, the sound detector arrangement150 can be configured to recognize one or more utterances (e.g., words, phrases, or other sounds producedby a user). In some implementations, the sound detectorarrangement 150 can be configured to recognize one ormore non-spoken sounds (e.g., screams or other soundsof  distress,  smoke  alarms,  glass  breakage,  car  crashsounds). The controller 112 may be configured to activateand/or perform one or more predetermined operations inresponse to the sound detector arrangement identification of a predetermined command or sound, e.g., providing an alarm signal in response to the user saying \"help!\"or \"call 911!\" or screaming, in response to which one ormore actions can occur-e.g., sounding an audible alarmon  the accessory,  emitting  light  from a  light  source  onthe accessory, causing the attached phone’s flash lightto turn on or strobe, causing the attached phone to trans-', 'mit  a  message  via  text  and/or  phone  call,  causing  themobile phone to emit sound, causing the mobile phoneto take photos or begin recording video, either throughthe forward-facing camera or the rearward-facing camera  or  the  both,  or  otherwise  any  operation  within  theattached  phone’s  functionalities.  Note  that  any  phonebased action could be achieved by the accessory’s transmitting to the mobile phone that an alarm condition hasbeen detected, e.g., in response to the user’s pushing abutton on the accessory, or in response to the proximitybetween the accessory and the wearable component being exceeded and/or in response to the wearable component being mechanically disconnected from the accessory, and/or in response to detection of a predeterminedsound.In  some  implementations,  the  controller  112[0022]may  be configured  to activate  a function of  the  mobilephone 200 in response to the sound detector arrangement identification of a predetermined sound. For example, the mobile phone 200 may be configured with a voiceassistant  (e.g.,  GOOGLE  ASSISTANT,  SIRI,  ALEXA,CORTANA,  BIXBY),  and  the  sound  detector  arrangement 150  can be configured to recognize  one or  more\"wake up\" phrases associated with voice assistants thatare installed on the mobile phone 200 (e.g., \"ok Google\",\"hey  Siri\",  \"Alexa\",  \"hey  Cortana\",  \"hi  Bixby\"),  and  theaccessory 100 can send a command to the mobile phone200 that will activate the corresponding voice assistantto process the rest of the user’s command. In some implementations, the microphone 152 may be configuredas a supplement or substitute for the microphone 211.In some implementations, the mobile accessory device100 can unlock access to a voice assistant on the mobilephone 200. For example, some configurations of mobilephones and/or voice assistants may require the user tofirst unlock the mobile phone or perform some other preliminary action before a voice assistant can respond toverbal commands. The mobile accessory device 100 canrecognize a \"wake up\" word/phrase and send a commandto the mobile phone 200, where an application runningin the background on the mobile phone 200 can receivethe  command  and  respond  by  unlocking  the  mobilephone 200 and/or otherwise placing the voice assistantin condition to respond to the user. In some implementations, the user can choose to opt-in to grant the phoneapplication sufficient security privileges to bypass or otherwise  release  phone  security  features  (e.g.,  screenlocks)  that  need  to  be  dismissed  in  order  to  make  thevoice assistant responsive and/or useful.[0023] With regard to wearable components, as illustrated in FIG. 5, in one embodiment the wearable component 120 may comprise a wrist strap. Initially, the userinput  sensor  122  and  the  wearable  component  120  ofthe  user  separation  sensor  arrangement  118  may  bephysically connected. For example, as illustrated in FIG.5, a lanyard 124 (e.g., mechanical tether) may connectthe wearable component 120 to the housing  102 via aconnector 126.', 'EP 4 054 160 A1', '[0024] As noted above, the controller 112 may be activated  in response  to receipt of  a  signal generated bythe user separation sensor arrangement 118 when theuser separation sensor arrangement 118 determines thatthe wearable component 120 has become physically detached from the accessory, and/or exceeds a thresholdseparation  distance  from  the  user  input  sensor  122.Thereby, the threshold separation distance may be defined between the housing 102 and the wearable component 120. Thus, for example, the lanyard 124 may havea predetermined length that at least partially defines thethreshold distance, and the lanyard may be configuredto mechanically and/or electrically attach to the housing102 and separate from  the  housing 102 when the distance  between  the  wearable  component  120  and  thehousing  102  exceeds  the  predetermined  length  of  thelanyard  124. The  user  separation  sensor  arrangement118 can include a user input sensor configured to determine whether the housing 102 and the lanyard are mechanically and/or electrically separated and provide analarm signal in response.[0025] As illustrated in FIG. 6, when a user’s wrist towhich the wearable component 120 is attached movesaway from the housing 102 of the mobile accessory device 100 by a distance exceeding the length of the lanyard124, the lanyard may pull out (e.g., separate, break away)the connector 126 from the housing 102 and out of engagement with the user input sensor 122, thereby activating the controller 112 (see, FIG. 7).[0026] Further, in one embodiment the connector 126may include a whistle. Thereby, once the connector 126is removed from the housing 102, the user may blow onthe whistle to bring attention to the user’s circumstances,scare away an assailant, and/or summon help.In an alternate embodiment, the connector ex[0027]tending from the wearable component may be configuredto engage a power and/or data port of the mobile phoneor  a  headphone  jack  thereon.  In  this  embodiment,  themobile phone may itself (e.g., via a software applicationexecuting  on  the  mobile  phone)  detect  detachment  orseparation of the wearable component from the port orjack, thereby activating the alarm device.[0028] As schematically illustrated in FIG. 7, the mobileaccessory  device  100  may  also  include  a  switch  128.The switch 128 may be provided in addition to, or as analternate  for,  the  user  separation  sensor  arrangement118. In a preferred embodiment, both the user separationsensor arrangement 118 and the switch 128 are provided.[0029] An example embodiment of  the  switch 128 isillustrated in FIGS. 1 and 3-6. In some embodiments itmay be desirable to provide the switch 128 with featuresconfigured to prevent accidental actuation thereof so asto avoid accidental activation of the controller 112 (see,FIG. 7). In this regard, in some embodiments actuationof the switch 128 may require movement of the switchalong a non-linear path. For example, FIG. 8 illustratesan enlarged example embodiment of an embodiment of', 'the switch 128A. As illustrated, the switch 128A may include a center button 130 and a slider 132. In order toactivate the switch 128A, a user may slide the slider 132in order to depress the center button 130. Thereby, issueswith respect to accident actuation of the switch 128A maybe  mitigated.  Various  other  switches  requiring  multistage actuation may be provided in other embodiments.[0030] The controller 112 may be configured to be activated in response to a signal from the user separationsensor arrangement 118 and/or the switch 128. The particular response by the controller 112 may be set as desired. In some embodiments activation of the controller112 by the switch 128 may result in the same responseas activation of the alarm device by the user separationsensor  arrangement  118.  However,  in  other  embodiments activation of the controller 112 by the switch 128may result in a different response as compared to activation of the alarm device by the user separation sensorarrangement 118.[0031] For example, the controller 112 may be configured  to  output  an  audible  alarm  configured  to  outputsounds,  predetermined  spoken  words,  and/or  noises(e.g., siren, buzzer, bell, speech) that are loud enoughto attract attention from others in the vicinity of the mobilephone  200  when  the  user  separation  sensor  arrangement 118 determines that the threshold separation distance is exceeded. In this regard, one or both of the audiooutput device 114 and the light output device 116 maybe activated. However, in some configurations, the controller 112 may be silently activated when the switch 128is actuated (e.g., the controller 112 or the mobile phone200 may be configured to omit the emission of an attention-getting  sound  during  activation).  In  some  embodiments, a silent alarm can refer to any appropriate circuitand/or mechanism for taking a predetermined action inresponse to a trigger, and does not necessarily require(nor preclude) that the alarm device is itself incapable ofgenerating an audible alarm.In this regard, the controller 112 may be config[0032]ured to direct the mobile phone 200 to send a communication (e.g., a telephone call, an SMS text message, aninstant message, and email) to one or more predefinedrecipients in response to actuation of the switch 128. Insome implementations, the communication can includeone or more predetermined messages (e.g., pre-recorded  voice  message,  pre-configured  text  or  synthesizedvoice message). In some implementations, the communication can be sent to one or more predetermined recipients (e.g., emergency response center, 911, police,user contacts). The controller 112 may be configured todirect the mobile phone 200 to send a communication toone or more predefined recipients when the user separation  sensor  arrangement  118  determines  that  thethreshold separation distance from the wearable component 120 is exceeded, and/or that the wearable component 120 has become detached from the mobile accessory device 100.[0033] The controller 112 may be configured to direct', 'EP 4 054 160 A1', 'the mobile phone 200 to activate a camera 207 (e.g., tocapture still or motion video of the surroundings), a microphone 211 (e.g., to capture sounds in the surroundingenvironment),  a  position  location  detector  system  154(e.g., GPS or other location system to identify a local orglobal location of the phone), light output system to emita visual indicator (e.g., blink an onboard LED, flash thephone’s screen), and/or audio output system (e.g., builtin speaker of the phone, to emit an audible alarm or callfor help) of the mobile phone 200, In some implementations, the communication can include one or more of adistress  message,  positioning  coordinates  of  a  determined position location (e.g., based on a GPS sensor inthe mobile device), audio captured by mobile device, andvideo captured by the mobile device. The functionality ofbeing able to send a communication in response to analarm  or  other  predetermined condition  may  be implemented by specialized software installed on and executed by  the mobile device, for example, a downloadablesoftware application (e.g., app) or other software component.[0034] To transmit such notifications, as schematicallyillustrated  in  FIG.  7,  the  mobile  accessory  device  100may  further  comprise  a  communication  interface  134(e.g., a communication circuit, communication circuitry).The communication interface 134 may be configured tocommunicate with a communication interface 206 (e.g.,a communication circuit, communication circuitry) of themobile phone 200 when directed by the controller 112.The communication interface 134 of the mobile accessory device 100 and the communication interface 206 ofthe mobile phone 200 may be any suitable arrangement,such as a device or circuitry embodied in either hardware,software, or a combination thereof that is configured toreceive and/or transmit data. The communication interfaces 134, 206 may be configured to receive and/or transmit data via a wired communication connection or wireless communication connection. In this regard, the communication interfaces 134, 206 may include, for example,an antenna and supporting wireless transmitter, receiver,or  transceiver  hardware  and/or hardwired componentsand/or software. For example, the communication interface 134 of the mobile accessory device 100 may includea wireless transmitter, receiver, or transceiver configuredto communicate with the communication interface 206 ofthe mobile phone 200 via BLUETOOTH, photonic (e.g.,infrared, IRDA), acoustic, ultrasonic, ZigBee, WiFi, or anyother  appropriate  communication  format.  Further,  thecommunication  interface  206  of  the  mobile  phone  200may be configured to communicate with one or more cellular networks via any known communication standard.[0035] Thereby,  the  communication  interface  206  ofthe mobile phone 200 may send a communication to oneor more designated contacts. The designated contactsmay be selected by the user via a user-installable software application that may be loaded on the mobile phone200. The type and/or content of the message may alsobe configured within the application.', 'In some embodiments, the communication may[0036]include a phone call with an audible message. For example, a prerecorded message may be played to conveya request for help. Alternatively or additionally, the mobilephone 200 may activate a microphone 211 thereof suchthat a recipient of the call may receive audio relating tothe user of mobile accessory’s circumstances (e.g., voiceor other sounds corresponding to words or actions of themobile phone user or anyone or anything else within therange of the mobile phone’s microphone 208).In some embodiments, the communication may[0037]include a video communication. For example, the mobilephone 200 may activate a camera 207 thereof such thata recipient of the call may receive video relating to theuser of accessory’s circumstances (e.g., video and audiowithin the range of the mobile device’s camera 207 andmicrophone 208).In some embodiments, the communication may[0038]include a text message, an email, or any other electroniccommunication.  Thereby,  the  communication  may  include, for example, a message conveying a request forhelp and/or instructing the recipient to call police or otheremergency  services.  The  communication  may  also  include  location  data  regarding  a  position  of  the  mobilephone 200. For example, the mobile phone 200 may further include a positioning system sensor 210 (e.g., GPS,GLONASS, indoor positioning), which may determine alocation thereof, and such location information may beincluded in the communication transmitted by the communication interface 206 of the mobile phone. In anotherexample, the mobile accessory device 100 may furtherinclude  a  position  location  detector  system  154  (e.g.,GPS, GLONASS, indoor positioning), which may determine  a  location  thereof,  and  such  location  informationmay be included in the communication transmitted by thecommunication  interface  134  of  the  mobile  accessory.For example, the recipients of the communication maybe provided with an  image showing the position  of themobile  phone  200  and/or  a  link  to  a  map  showing  theposition. Such a map may be updated with the positonof the mobile phone 200 such that the position thereofmay  be  tracked  in  the  event  that  movement  occurs.Thereby, emergency service personnel may be directedto the location of the mobile phone 200.In another embodiment, communications may[0039]additionally or alternatively be transmitted to other usersof mobile accessory devices in local proximity to the mobile accessory device 100. For example, the communication interface 134 of the mobile accessory device 100may directly communicate with the communication interface of other nearby mobile phone accessories to alerttheir  users  of  a  nearby  user  in  need  of  assistance.  Insome embodiments the mobile accessory devices 100may form a mesh network via the communication interfaces 134 to expand the reach of the local alerts.[0040] FIG. 9 schematically illustrates control circuitrycomponents of the controller 112 (e.g., an alarm device)according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.', 'EP 4 054 160 A1', 'As illustrated, the  control  circuitry of  the controller  112may  include  or  otherwise  be  in  communication  with  aprocessor 136 and a memory device 138.[0041] The  processor  136  may  be  embodied  in  anumber of different  forms. For example,  the processor136 may be embodied as one or more of various processing means such as a coprocessor, a microprocessor, acontroller, a digital signal processor (DSP), processingcircuitry,  or  various  other  processing devices  includingintegrated circuits such as, for example, a special-purpose computer chip, or other hardware processor. In anexample embodiment, the processor 136 may be configured to execute instructions stored in the memory device138 or  otherwise  accessible to the  processor. Alternatively or additionally, the processor 136 may be configured to execute  hard coded  functionality. As such, theprocessor 136 may be capable of performing operationsaccording  to  embodiments  of  the  present  disclosurewhile  configured  accordingly.  Alternatively,  when  theprocessor 136 is embodied as an executor of softwareinstructions,  the instructions may  specifically configurethe processor to perform the operations described herein. The processor 136 may include a clock, an arithmeticlogic  unit  (ALU)  and  logic  gates  configured  to  supportoperation of the processor, amongst other components.[0042] The memory device 138 may include non-transitory  and  tangible  memory  that  may  be,  for  example,volatile and/or non-volatile memory. The memory device138 may be configured to store information, data, files,applications,  instructions  or  the  like.  For  example,  thememory  device  138  can  be  configured  to  buffer  inputdata for processing by the processor 136. Additionally oralternatively, the memory device 138 can be configuredto store instructions for execution by the processor 136.[0043] The processor 136 may be configured to execute program code instructions stored on a non-transitorycomputer readable medium. In this regard, an embodiment of a non-transitory computer readable medium forstoring  computer instructions executed  by  a processor(e.g., processor 136) is provided, such as the memorydevice 138. The non-transitory computer readable medium may comprise program code instructions for performing the alarm operations described herein.[0044] The various aspects, embodiments, implementations or features of the described embodiments can beused separately or in any combination. Various aspectsof the described embodiments can be implemented bysoftware,  hardware  or  a  combination  of  hardware  andsoftware. The described embodiments can also be embodied as computer readable code on a computer readable medium for controlling the above-described operations. In particular, computer readable code may be configured to perform each of the operations of the methodsdescribed  herein and embodied as computer  readablecode on a computer readable medium for controlling theabove-described operations. In this regard, a computerreadable  storage  medium,  as  used  herein,  refers  to  anon-transitory, physical storage medium (e.g., a volatile', 'or non-volatile memory device, which can be read by acomputer system.  Examples of the  computer readablemedium  include  read-only  memory,  random-accessmemory, CD-ROMs, DVDs, magnetic tape, and opticaldata  storage devices. The computer  readable  mediumcan also be distributed over network-coupled computersystems  so  that  the  computer  readable  code  is  storedand executed in a distributed fashion.[0045] Although the present disclosure is generally described as relating to a mobile accessory, in another embodiment some or all of the components of the mobileaccessory described above may be included in a standalone personal safety device (see, e.g., FIG. 23). In other words, a personal safety device may be configured foruse  without  requiring a  separate mobile phone.  In  thisregard, the personal safety device may be configured tocommunicate  with  cellular  networks  and  configured  todetermine a location of the personal safety device. Thus,for example, the communication interface may be configured to communicate with cellular or satellite networksin order to allow for transmission of electronic communications  and  the  personal safety  device  may further include a GPS sensor configured to determine the locationof the personal safety device.[0046] As noted above, the form factor of the mobileaccessory device 100 may vary. In this regard, FIG. 10illustrates an embodiment of the mobile accessory device100A including the switch 128 of FIG. 8. FIG. 11 illustratesan embodiment of the mobile accessory device 100B provided in the form of a case. FIG. 12 illustrates an embodiment of the mobile accessory device 100C wherein themobile accessory is substantially rectangular with rounded corners. FIG. 13 illustrates an embodiment of the mobile accessory device 100D wherein the mobile accessory is round. FIG. 14 illustrates an embodiment of themobile accessory device 100E wherein the user separation  sensor  arrangement  includes  a  wireless  wearablecomponent 120D. FIGS. 15-18 illustrate an embodimentof the mobile accessory device 100F wherein the mobileaccessory is ovular. FIG. 19 illustrates an embodimentof the mobile accessory device 100G wherein the wearable component of the user separation sensor arrangement  is  not  attached  for  illustration  purposes.  FIG.  20illustrates an embodiment of the mobile accessory device100H wherein a mobile phone is not attached for illustration purposes. FIG. 21 illustrates an embodiment of themobile  accessory  device  1001  wherein  the  mobile  accessory is attached to a case 208 for the mobile phone200.In examples such as the mobile accessory de[0047]vice 100E and the wearable component 120D of FIG. 14,the connection between the wearable component 120Dand the mobile accessory device 100E may be wireless.For example, the connection may be a radio frequencyconnection (e.g., BLUETOOTH connection), a photonicconnection (e.g., infrared beacon, IrDA), sonic (e.g., ultrasonic beacon), or magnetic (e.g., a Hall sensor in themobile accessory device activated when a magnet in the', 'EP 4 054 160 A1', 'wearable component or the mobile phone is moved toofar away).In some embodiments, the user separation sen[0048]sor arrangement 118 can be configured to measure orotherwise detect a strength of a wireless signal providedby the wearable component. The strength of the signalcan  be  proportional  or  otherwise  representative  of  thedistance between the wearable component and the userseparation sensor arrangement 118 (e.g., the larger theseparation distance, the weaker the received signal willbe). The user separation sensor arrangement 118 cancompare the strength of the received signal to a predetermined threshold signal strength value. If the receivedsignal strength is determined to be less than the thresholdsignal  strength  value,  the  user  separation  sensor  arrangement  118  can  provide  an  activation  signal to thecontroller 112. In some embodiments, the user separation sensor arrangement 118 may be configured to detectthe presence and/or absence of a beacon signal, and thethreshold signal strength value can be a timeout value.For example, the wearable component 120D can be configured to emit a beacon signal once every second, andthe threshold signal strength value can be set to five seconds.  In  this  example,  the  user  separation  sensor  arrangement 118 can determine that no beacon signal hasbeen received for at least five seconds, and respond bydetermining  that  the  wearable  component  120D  is  nolonger in proximity (and/or physically attached) to the mobile  accessory  device  100E  and  provide  an  activationsignal to the controller 112.[0049] FIGs. 22A-F illustrate steps associated with usage of a wearable component 120I (e.g., a wrist strap)of the mobile accessory device 1001 of FIG. 21. FIG. 22Ashows a mobile phone 200 having an attached (e.g., adhesively, with tabs/slots, or hooks and loops) mobile accessory  device  1001.  The  microphone  of  the  mobilephone 200 is shown at 208. The mobile accessory device1001 includes a groove 209 defined in the surface of themobile  accessory  device  1001,  sized  to accommodatestorage of the wearable component 1201. FIGs. 22B-Dshow  a  user  in  the  process  of  removing  the  wearablecomponent 1201 from the groove 209 so that he or shecan engage the wearable component 1201 into a wornposition, such as shown in FIG. 22E (e.g., donned upona wrist). FIG. 22F illustrates how the user might hold mobile  phone  200  after he or she has removed wearablecomponent 1201 form the groove 209 and put it aroundhis or her wrist. The user can later remove (e.g., doff) thewearable component 1201 and stow it in the groove 209.[0050] FIG. 23 illustrates an embodiment of a personalsafety device 300 that does not require usage of a separate mobile phone, but rather is implemented as a standalone, dedicated personal  safety device. Such a  personal safety device 300 may have sufficient componentsand functionalities to perform the operation[0051] Further, FIGS. 24-26 illustrate an embodimentof the mobile accessory device 100J according to an additional example embodiment of the present disclosure.', 'The mobile accessory device 100J is illustrated as beingattached to the mobile phone 200 as discussed above.The overall configuration and features of the mobile accessory device 100J may be substantially similar to thatof the mobile accessory device 100 of FIG. 1. However,the mobile accessory device 100J of FIGS. 24-26 mayvary in one or more respects.[0052] For example, as illustrated, the position of thecomponents of the mobile accessory device 100J relativeto  the  housing  102J  may vary. In  this  regard,  the  lightoutput device 116J may be positioned at a top center ofthe outer surface 106J of the housing 102J. This configuration may allow the light output device 116J to be exposed and visible above the top of the user’s hand in theevent of activation while in the user’s hand, such that itis more noticeable. The audio output device 114J maybe  positioned  in  a  similar  location  as  compared  to  theaudio output device 114 of the mobile accessory device100 of FIG. 1, but the housing 102J may include a patternof round holes defined there through that allow soundsto  exit  the  mobile  accessory  device  100J.  Further,  theswitch  128J  may  be  substantially  similar  to  the  switch128A  described  above  with  respect  to  FIG.  8,  but  theends  thereof  may  be  relatively  more  rounded  for  improved ergonomics and/or appearance. Additionally, thebattery portion may be positioned at the attachment surface of the mobile accessory device 100J engaged withthe mobile phone 200 in order to de-clutter the exposedouter surfaces thereof.[0053] Further, the mobile accessory device 100J mayinclude a nail slot 140J, which may be positioned betweenthe connector 126J and the housing 102J. In this regard,in  some  embodiments  the  user  separation  sensor  arrangement may be activated by engaging a fingernail inthe nail slot 140J and releasing the connector 126 ratherthan requiring the user to release the wearable component 120J first. Thereby, activation of the user separationsensor arrangement may be conducted quickly (e.g., inan unexpected dangerous situation), if necessary.[0054] Further, the particular configuration of the wearable component 120J may differ. In this regard, as illustrated in FIGS. 24-26, in an un-extended configuration,the lanyard 124J may wrap around a lower comer of thehousing 102J and extend to and wrap around a top comerof the housing. The wearable component 120J may thenextend downward from the lanyard 124J to the bottomedge of the housing 102J. A clip 142J may be positionedat the interface between the lanyard 124J and the wearable  component  120J.  In  some  embodiments,  the  clip142J may be moveable such that the relative length ofthe  wearable  component  120J  relative  to  the  lanyard124J is adjustable  and thereby  a  user may tighten thewearable component around his or her wrist during use.The clip 142J may be configured to engage the housing102J when in an un-extended configuration to retain thelanyard 124J in place.[0055] Further, the wearable component 120J may include a pull tab 144J at an end thereof. The pull tab 144J', 'EP 4 054 160 A1', 'may retain the wearable component 120J in the un-extended configuration until the user releases the pull tabfrom engagement with the housing 102J. Releasing thepull  tab  144J  from engagement with  the housing 102Jmay activate one or more features. For example, in response to the pull tab 144J being released, the positioning system sensor 210 (see, FIG. 7) may be instructedto  activate  via  the  communication  mechanisms  described  above.  Accordingly,  when  a  user  extends  thewearable  component  120J  and  places  it  on  his  or  herwrist, for example when confronted with a dangerous situation or location, the user’s location may be determinedand tracked at that time. Thereby, in the event that theuser pulls out the connector 126J, the positioning systemsensor 210 will have already been activated in order tosubstantially immediately provide the user’s location asdescribed above. Thereby, for example, any delays associated  with  determining  the  user’s  location  may  beavoided. Further, the user’s location may be tracked during the time period during which the pull tab 144J is released and thereby the user’s location information mayoptionally be shared with one or more persons, if desired.[0056] The  embodiment of the mobile accessory device 100K illustrated in FIGS. 27 and 28 is substantiallysimilar to the mobile accessory of FIGS. 24-26 in mostrespects and hence the configuration thereof will not berepeated. However, the nail slot 140K is enlarged.[0057] FIGs. 29-35 illustrate various views of anotherexample mobile accessory device 1001 according to anadditional  example  embodiment  of  the  present  disclosure. The mobile accessory device 100L is configured tobe attached to the mobile phone 200 as will be discussedfurther below. The overall configuration and features ofthe mobile accessory device 100L may be substantiallysimilar to that of the mobile accessory device 100 of FIG.1. However, the mobile accessory device 100L of FIGS.29-35 may vary in one or more respects.[0058] For example, as illustrated, the position of thecomponents of the mobile accessory device 100L relativeto the housing 102L may vary. The audio output device114L may be positioned in a similar location as comparedto the audio output device 114 of the mobile accessorydevice 100 of FIG. 1, but the housing 102L may includea round hole defined there through that allow sounds toexit the mobile accessory device 100L.[0059] Further, the particular configuration of the wearable component 120L may differ. In this regard, as illustrated in FIGS. 29-35, in an un-extended configuration,wearable component 120L and the lanyard 124L may bestow-able in a groove 2909 formed about the peripheryof the housing 102L. Further, the wearable component120L may include a pull tab 144L at an end thereof. Thepull tab 144L may retain the wearable component 120Lin the stowed (e.g., un-extended) configuration until theuser releases the pull  tab 144L from engagement withthe housing 102L. Releasing the pull tab 144L from engagement  with  the  housing  102L  may  activate  one  ormore features. For example, in response to the pull tab', '144L being released, the positioning system sensor 210(see, FIG. 7) may be instructed to activate via the communication mechanisms described above. Accordingly,when  a  user  removes  the  wearable  component  120Lfrom the groove 2909 and places it on his or her wrist,for example when confronted with a dangerous situationor location, the user’s location may be determined andtracked at that time. Thereby, in the event that the userpulls out the connector 126L, the positioning system sensor 210 will have already been activated in order to substantially immediately provide the user’s location as described above. Thereby, for example, any delays associated with determining the user’s location may be avoided.  Further,  the  user’s  location  may  be  tracked  duringthe time period during which the pull tab 144L is releasedand thereby the user’s location information may optionally be shared with one or more persons, if desired.[0060] Further, the switch 128L may be a pressure sensitive  or  membrane  switch  defined  as  a  fingertip-sizedrecess having a textured pattern (e.g., to ease identification  and  location  of  the  switch  128L  by  either  sight  ortouch).  In  use,  the  switch  may  be  used  to  activate  analarm  though  a  predetermined  continuous  press  (e.g.,three  seconds)  or  through  a  predetermined  series  ofpresses (e.g., three presses within five seconds), for example, to reduce the occurrence of accidental activation.In some implementations, the switch 128L may activatea different type of alarm than may be triggered by separation of the lanyard. For example, the mobile accessorydevice 100L may respond to activation of the switch 128Lby initiating a silent alarm to alert one or more predetermined recipients (e.g., discretely sending a message toa preselected contact), while the mobile accessory device 100L may respond to separation of the connector126L by initiating an audible alarm  and alerting one ormore predetermined recipients (e.g., set off a siren andsend a message or place a phone call to police).[0061] Further, the mobile accessory device 100L mayinclude a nail slot positioned between the connector 126Land the housing 102L. In this regard, in some embodiments the user separation sensor arrangement may beactivated  by  engaging  a  fingernail  in  the  nail  slot  andreleasing  the  connector  126L  rather than  requiring  theuser  to  release  the  wearable  component  120L  first.Thereby,  activation  of  the  user  separation  sensor  arrangement may be conducted quickly (e.g., in an unexpected dangerous situation), if necessary.[0062] The  mobile  accessory  device  100L  also  includes a visual indicator 2902 (e.g.,  a  light, a  display).The visual indicator 2902 is configured to provide a visibleindication of one or more statuses of the mobile accessory device. For example, the visual indicator 2902 mayblink at a first rate or pattern (e.g., or illuminate steadily),illuminate at a  first  brightness,  and/or  illuminate  with  afirst color to display a first condition (e.g., to indicate thatthe  mobile  accessory  device  100L  is  connected  to  orpaired with the mobile phone 200 and/or an associatedalarm software application  running on  the phone), and', 'EP 4 054 160 A1', 'blink,  illuminate,  and/or  colorize  in  different  predetermined manners to display other conditions (e.g., to indicate that the mobile accessory device 100L is not pairedor  otherwise  communicatively  associated  with  mobilephone 200, to indicate that the mobile accessory device100L is not able to communicate with the mobile phone200 to which it was previously paired or otherwise communicatively associated). In some embodiments, the visual indicator 2902 may display differently shaped predetermined patterns to indicate different conditions of themobile accessory device 100L. For example, the visualindicator 2902 may appear as a periodically blinking, blueBLUETOOTH symbol to indicate that the mobile accessory device 100L is ready for pairing, and may appearas a red \"X\" when the mobile accessory device 100L isnot able to communicate with the paired mobile phone200 or an associated software application installed thereupon  and  configured  to  respond  to  alarm  signals  fromthe mobile accessory device 100L.[0063] Referring  now  to  FIG.  35,  a  rear  perspectiveview of the mobile accessory device 100L is shown. Therear side of the housing 102L includes an adhesive pad3502. In use, the adhesive pad 3502 can be contactedagainst a surface of the mobile phone 200 (e.g., the rearsurface 202).[0064] FIG. 36 is a flow chart of an example process3600 for using an example mobile accessory device. Insome  implementations,  the  process  3600  can  be  performed using one or more of the example mobile deviceaccessories 100A-100L of  FIGs. 1-23, and 25-35,  andthe personal safety device 300 of FIG. 23.[0065] At 3610, an attachment surface of a housing ofa mobile accessory device is engaged to a mobile device.For example, the attachment surface 104 of the housing102 may be configured to engage the rear surface 202of the mobile phone 200. In another example, the adhesive pad 3502 shown in FIG. 35 can be used to securethe  mobile  accessory  device  100L  to  a  mobile  device,such as to the rear surface 202 of the mobile phone 200.[0066] At 3620, a wearable component is donned upona user of the mobile device. For example, the wearablecomponent 120 of FIG. 5, the wireless wearable component 120D of FIG. 14, and/or the wearable component1201 of FIGs 22A-F can be worn about a user’s wrist. Inother  examples,  the  wearable  component  can  donnedupon or otherwise carried by a user (e.g., a pendant, aring, an earring, an earpiece, bracelet, wristwatch, eyeglass frame, hair clip), the user’s clothing (e.g., a remoteunit carried in the user’s pocket, a pin, a badge, clippedto a belt, a belt buckle, head band, hat), and/or the user’spersonal effects (e.g., a remote unit carried in purse orbag, a key fob, an identification card).[0067] At  3630,  a  separation sensor  detects  that thewearable  component  has  separated from  the  housing.For example, the user input sensor 122 can determinethat  the  wearable  component  120  has  exceeded  athreshold  separation  distance  from  the  controller  112and/or  that  the  wearable  component  120  has  become', 'physically  detached  from  the  mobile  accessory  device100.In some embodiments,  the process  3600  can[0068]include detecting a mechanical separation of the housingand  a  lanyard  affixed  to  the  wearable  component,  thelanyard having a predetermined length and mechanicallyconnecting the wearable component to the housing, thelanyard being mechanically separable from the housingwhen  distance  between  the  wearable  component  andthe housing exceeds the predetermined length. For example, the user input sensor 122 can determine that thewearable component 120 has become detached, disengaged, or otherwise physically separated from the controller 112.In some embodiments, detecting that the wear[0069]able component has separated from the housing can include determining a signal strength of a wireless tethersignal transmitted by a wireless transmitter of the wearable  component to  a wireless  receiver arranged withinthe housing  and  in  communication with the  separationsensor, the signal strength being representative of a distance between the wearable component and the housing,and determining that the signal strength is less than orequal to a predetermined signal strength defining a predetermined separation distance. For example, the userseparation sensor arrangement 118 can determine thatthe wearable component 120D has exceeded a thresholdseparation distance from the controller 112, or that a periodic  beacon  transmitted  by  the  wearable  component120D has not been received for a predetermined lengthof time.[0070] At 3640, an alarm device is activated based ondetecting  that  the  wearable  component  has  separatedfrom the housing. For example, the controller 112 of FIG.7 can be activated. In some embodiments, activating thealarm  device  can  include  transmitting  an  alarm  signal;and wherein the process 3600 can also include receiving,by mobile device, the alarm signal, and sending, by themobile device and in response to the receiving the alarmsignal, a predetermined communication to one or morepredefined recipients. For example, the controller 112 ofFIG. 7 can activate the communication interface 134 tocommunicate  with  the  mobile  phone  200.  The  mobilephone 200 may have a software application installed andexecuting thereupon,  and  the software application  canbe  configured  to  react  to  the  communication  from  themobile accessory device 100E to cause the mobile phoneto communicate with one or more predetermined recipients. For example, the software application may be configured to initiate a call, send a text message, email, media  file,  media  stream,  location  information  (e.g.,  GPSdata), captured audio and/or video, or any other appropriate  information  to  one  or  more  contacts  previouslyidentified by the user (e.g., family member, friend, neighbor, doctor, nurse, caregiver, welfare official, emergencyservices, 911)In some embodiments, activating the alarm de[0071]vice can include activating an audio output component', 'EP 4 054 160 A1', 'disposed within the housing  and configured to emit anaudible alert when activated. For example, the controller112 includes the audio output device 114 that can emita siren, noise, prerecorded or synthesized spoken wordsor other sounds, or any other appropriate sound that issufficiently loud enough to attract the attention of othernearby persons and/or  repel an attacker.  In some embodiments, activating the alarm device can include activating a visual output configured to emit an audible alertwhen activated. For example, the controller 112 includesthe light output device 116 that can emit a light or strobeto  attract  the  attention  of  other  nearby  persons  and/orrepel an attacker.In  some  embodiments, the  process 3600 can[0072]include removing the wearable component from a cavitydefined  by  the  housing,  wherein  the  cavity  is  sized  toaccommodate storage of the wearable component. Forexample, FIGs. 22A-22F show that the example wearable component 1201 can be at least partly removed fromthe  mobile  accessory  device  1001  before  being  wornabout the wrist of the user. In some embodiments, theprocess 3600 can also include doffing the wearable component from the user, and stowing the wearable component in a cavity defined by the housing, wherein the cavityis sized to accommodate storage of the wearable component.  For  example,  the  process  illustrated  by  FIGs.22A-22F can be reversed such that the user can take thewearable component 1201 or 120L off his or her wrist,and placed back in the groove 209 or 2909 defined in thehousing of the mobile accessory device 1001 or 100L.[0073] FIGs. 37a-45 illustrate various views of anotherexample mobile accessory device 100M according to anadditional  example  embodiment  of  the  present  disclosure. The mobile accessory device 100M is configuredto be attached to the mobile phone 200, either directly orindirectly, as will be discussed further below. The overallconfiguration and features of the mobile accessory device 100M may be substantially similar to, or a subset of,that of the mobile accessory device 100 of FIG. 1. However, the mobile accessory device 100M of FIGS. 37a45 may vary in one or more respects.[0074] The mobile accessory device 100M includes auser  input  sensor  having a  movable  component  144M(e.g., a pull tab), which serves as a user input mechanism,and is configured to activate when the movable component 144M is at least partially moved, and an alarm device(not shown) disposed in the housing 102M and configured to activate in response to activation of the user inputsensor. Activation of the alarm device can cause an audible alarm, or cause a software application to be executed  on  the  mobile  phone  200,  or  both.  The  audiblealarm can come either from an optional audio emittingdevice disposed in the mobile accessory device 100M or(e.g., in embodiments where the mobile accessory device  100M  does  not  include  an  audio  emitting  device)from the mobile phone 200, e.g., using a speaker builtinto the mobile phone 200.[0075] For example, as illustrated, the position of the', 'components of the mobile accessory device 100M relative to a housing 102M may vary. A pull tab 144M is configured to remain in a stowed (e.g., un-extended) configuration  until  the  user  releases  the  pull  tab  144M  fromengagement with  the  housing 102M  or  moves  the  pulltab 144M relative to the housing 102M. Releasing or moving the pull tab 144M may activate one or more features.For  example,  in  response  to  the  pull  tab  144M  beingmoved, removed (at least in part), shifted, or released,the positioning system sensor 210 (see, FIG. 7) may beinstructed  to  activate  via  the  communication  mechanisms described above. Further, the user’s location maybe  tracked,  e.g.,  using  GPS-like  functionality  built  intothe mobile  phone 200, during  the time period  in whichthe pull tab 144M is released and thereby the user’s location information may optionally be shared with one ormore persons, if desired, e.g., using the communicationscapabilities of the mobile phone 200 (e.g., phone, email,SMS text).[0076] Further,  the  mobile  accessory  device  100Mmay include a slot 126M or a feature providing equivalentfunctionality, positioned between the pull tab 144M andthe housing 102M. In this regard, in some embodimentsthe user separation sensor arrangement may be activated, for example, by engaging a fingernail or equivalentin the slot 126M and moving the pull tab 144M. Thereby,based  on  user  input,  activation  of  the  user  separationsensor arrangement may be conducted quickly (e.g., inan unexpected dangerous situation), if necessary, for example, by moving (at least in part) the pull tab 144M.In  some  embodiments,  the  slot  126M,  which[0077]serves as a user input mechanism, may be supplemented or substituted with one or more other mechanical features  configured  to  provide  frictional,  grippable,  orgraspable surface or element to ease releasing or movingthe pull tab 144M. Examples of such mechanical featurescan  include  raised  or  recessed  ribs,  dimples,  latches,loops,  hooks,  projections,  textures  (e.g.,  rough,  soft,sticky), or combinations of these or other mechanical features  that  can  promote  manual  operation  (e.g.,  movement or removal) of the pull tab 144M.[0078] Alternatively,  or  in  addition,  other  use  inputmechanisms (e.g., switches or buttons) may be used asa user input mechanism to trigger actuation of the mobileaccessory  device  100M.  In  one  such  embodiment,  aswitch 128M (e.g., a button) is arranged on a lateral side3710a of the housing 102M, substantially perpendicularto  a  major  face  surface  3712.  Another  switch  129M  isarranged on a lateral side 3710b of the housing 102M,substantially  perpendicular  to  the  major  face  surface3712 opposite the switch 129M. The switch 128M and/orthe switch 129M may be a depressible button, pressuresensitive, or membrane switches defined as a fingertipsized recess or protrusion having a textured pattern (e.g.,to  facilitate  identification  and  location  of  the  switch  byeither sight or touch). In use, the switch 128M and theswitch 129M  are pressed  substantially simultaneously.For example, in the illustrated configuration, a user can', 'EP 4 054 160 A1', 'squeeze the switch 128M and the switch 129M with twodifferent fingers of one hand in order to activate an alarm,thereby reducing a likelihood of false alarms due to accidental actuation of a single button. The switches maybe  used  to  activate  an  alarm  though  a  predeterminedcontinuous press (e.g., three seconds), through a predetermined series of presses (e.g., three presses within fiveseconds),  or through  a  particular sequence  of presses(e.g., first pressing the switch 128M and then the switch129M), for  example, to reduce  the occurrence of accidental activation.In  some  implementations,  the  switches  128M[0079]and  129M  may  activate  a  different  type  of  action  thanmay be triggered by separation of the pull tab 144M. Forexample,  the  mobile  accessory  device  100M  may  respond to activation of the switches 128M and 129M byinitiating a silent alarm to alert one or more predeterminedrecipients  (e.g.,  causing  the  mobile  phone  200  to  discretely send a message to a preselected contact), whilethe  mobile  accessory  device  100M  may  respond  tomovement or partial removal of the pull tab 144M by initiating an audible alarm and alerting one or more predetermined recipients (e.g., set off a siren and send a message or place a phone call to police). The audible alarmcan come either from an optional audio emitting devicedisposed in the mobile accessory device 100M or (e.g.,in  embodiments  where  the  mobile  accessory  device100M does not  include  an  audio emitting  device)  fromthe mobile phone 200, e.g., using a speaker built into themobile phone 200.In some embodiments, the movable component[0080](e.g.,  pull  tab  144M)  can  be  configured  to  be  at  leastpartly moved relative to the housing 102M when subjected to a predetermined force. In some embodiments, themobile accessory device 100M can include a wearablecomponent having a lanyard (e.g., the example wearablecomponent 120) configured to mechanically attach to thehousing 102M and/or the pull tab 144M and provide atleast the predetermined force to the movable componentbased on a pull of upon the lanyard and at least partlymove  the  movable  component  relative  to  the  housing102M based on the pull.[0081] FIG.  37b  shows  the  mobile  accessory  device100M adhered or affixed to a companion mobile accessory device 3701 (e.g., a wallet for holding identificationcards, credit cards, cash, or the like) which in turn is adhered or affixed to the mobile phone 200. However, themobile accessory device 100M can be adhered or affixeddirectly to the mobile phone 200 without the need for, oruse of, the companion mobile accessory device 3701.[0082] FIGs. 38-39 show the mobile accessory device100M attached to the companion mobile accessory device 3701 without the mobile phone 200, whereas FIG.40 shows the companion mobile accessory device 3701alone.[0083] FIGs. 41-43 show the mobile accessory device100M  separate  from  the  companion  mobile  accessorydevice  3701.  In some implementations, the  mobile ac-', 'cessory device 100M can engage (e.g., adhere to) a portion of the mobile phone 200. In some implementations,the mobile accessory device 100M can engage a portionof  a  companion  mobile  accessory  device  3701  (whichwill  be  discussed  further  in  the  description  of  FIGs.44-45). In some embodiments, the mobile accessory device 100M and the companion mobile accessory device3701 may be configured as two physically independentcomponents that may be adhered or otherwise mechanically engaged to each other or may be used independently. In some embodiments, the mobile accessory device 100M and the companion mobile accessory device3701 may be configured as a combined unit (e.g., formedas a monolithic, unitary assembly having a shared housing).[0084] Referring  now  to  FIG.  43,  a  rear  perspectiveview of the mobile accessory device 100M is shown. Amajor  face  4302  of  the  rear  side  of  the  housing  102Mincludes an adhesive pad 4301. In use, the adhesive pad4301 can be contacted against (e.g., adhered to) a surface of the mobile phone 200 (e.g., the rear surface 202),or the surface 3702 of the companion mobile accessorydevice 3701, or any other appropriate surface.[0085] Referring now to FIGs. 40 and 45, rear perspective  views  of  the  companion  mobile  accessory  device3701 is shown. A rear side 3703 of the companion mobileaccessory device 3701 includes an adhesive pad 4001.In use, the adhesive pad 4001 can be contacted againsta surface of the mobile phone 200 (e.g., the rear surface202), or any other appropriate surface.[0086] Referring now primarily to FIGs. 36-40, 44, and45,  the  companion  mobile  accessory  device  3701  isshown. The companion mobile accessory device 3701has a housing that defines a cavity 4002. The cavity 4002is  configured  to  removably  retain  one  or  more  walletsized  cards  3704,  such  as  credit  cards,  identificationcards (e.g., driver’s license), loyalty cards, security access cards, folded cash, or any other appropriately sizeditems.[0087] FIG. 46 is a flow chart of an example processfor using an example mobile accessory device. In someimplementations,  the  process  4600  can  be  performedusing one or more of the example mobile device accessories 100A-100L of FIGs. 1-23, and 25-35, the personalsafety device 300 of FIG. 23, and the mobile accessorydevice 100M of FIGs. 37a-43.[0088] At 4610, an attachment surface of a housing ofa mobile accessory device is engaged to a mobile device.For example, the major face 4302 of the housing 102Mmay be configured to engage the rear surface 202 of themobile phone 200. In another example, the adhesive pad4301 shown in FIG. 43 can be used to secure (e.g., adhere) the mobile accessory device 100M to the companion mobile accessory device 3701.[0089] At 4620, a user input is received. For example,one or a combination of the switches 128M, 129M mayhave been pressed by a user. In another example, thepull tab 144M may have been actuated or partly removed', 'EP 4 054 160 A1', 'by a user.[0090] At  4630,  a  separation  sensor  detects  that,based on the received user input, the mobile accessorydevice 100M has been actuated. For example, the userinput sensor 122 can determine that the pull tab 144Mhas been moved, removed (at least partially), releasedor shifted, or that the switch 128M and/or the button 129Mhas been pressed.In  some  embodiments, the  process 4600 can[0091]include detecting a mechanical separation of the housingand a lanyard affixed to a wearable component, the lanyard  having  a  predetermined  length  and  mechanicallyconnecting the wearable component to the housing, thelanyard being mechanically separable from the housingwhen  distance  between  the  wearable  component  andthe housing exceeds the predetermined length. For example, the pull tab 144M can be connected to the wearable component 120, and the user input sensor 122 candetermine that the wearable component 120 has causedthe pull tab 144M to move or at be at least partly removedfrom the housing 102M.[0092] At 4640, an alarm device is activated based ondetecting that the user input has been actuated. For example, the controller 112 of FIG. 7 can be activated. Insome embodiments, activating the alarm device can include transmitting an alarm signal; and wherein the process 4600 can also include receiving, by mobile device,the alarm signal, and sending, by the mobile device andin response to the receiving the alarm signal, a predetermined communication to one or more predefined recipients. For example, the controller 112 of FIG. 7 can activate the  communication interface 134 to  communicatewith the mobile phone 200. The mobile phone 200 mayhave  a  software  application  installed  and  executingthereupon, and the software application can be configured to react to the communication from the mobile accessory device 100M to cause the mobile phone to communicate  with  one  or  more  predetermined  recipients,and/or to emit an audible alarm or other sound. For example, the software application may be configured to initiate a call, send a text message, email, media file, mediastream, location information (e.g., GPS data), capturedaudio and/or video, or any other appropriate informationto one or more contacts previously identified by the user(e.g., family member, friend, neighbor, doctor, nurse, caregiver,  welfare  official,  emergency  services,  911).  Insome embodiments, the alarm device can be any appropriate circuit and/or mechanism that is configured for taking a predetermined action in response to a trigger, anddoes not necessarily require nor preclude that the alarmdevice is itself capable of generating an audible alarm.In some embodiments, activating the alarm de[0093]vice can include activating an audio output componentdisposed within the housing  and configured to emit anaudible  alert  when  activated.  For  example,  the  mobileaccessory device 100M can include the audio output device 114 that can emit a siren, noise, prerecorded or synthesized spoken words or other sounds, or any other ap-', 'propriate sound that is sufficiently loud enough to attractthe  attention  of  other  nearby  persons  and/or  repel  anattacker. In some embodiments, activating the alarm device can include activating a visual output configured toemit an audible alert when activated. For example, themobile accessory device 100M can include the light output device 116 that can emit a light or strobe to attractthe  attention  of  other  nearby  persons  and/or  repel  anattacker.In another configuration, the mobile accessory[0094]device need not be configured to be physically attachableto the mobile device, but rather may be implemented asa standalone unit that can be carried or worn by a user(e.g., as a wallet attachment or insert, key fob, bracelet,or the like), and which maintains a wireless communication connection between the accessory and the mobiledevice. In this configuration, other than the lack of physical attachment, the accessory can be designed and implemented to have any or all of the same features and/orfunctionality as the configuration in which the accessoryis designed to be attached to the mobile device, as described above.[0095] FIGs. 47-49B illustrate various views of a mobileaccessory device 100N according to an additional example  embodiment  of  the  present  disclosure.  The  mobileaccessory device 100N is configured to be attached tothe mobile phone 200, either directly or indirectly, as willbe discussed further below. The overall configuration andfeatures of the  mobile accessory device 100N may besubstantially similar to, or a subset of, that of the mobileaccessory  device  100  of  FIG.  1.  However,  the  mobileaccessory device 100N of FIGS. 47-49B may vary in oneor more respects.[0096] The mobile accessory device 100N includes ahousing 102N and a user input sensor having a movablecomponent 4744 (e.g., a sliding switch, a pull tab, a trigger component),  which  serves  as  a user input mechanism,  and  is  configured  to  activate  when  the  movablecomponent 4744 is at least partially moved relative to thehousing 102N, and controller (e.g., the controller 112 ofFIG. 7, not shown here) disposed in the housing 102Nand  configured  to  activate  in  response  to  activation  ofthe  user  input  sensor.  Activation  of  the  controller  cancause an audible alarm, or cause a software applicationto be executed on the mobile phone 200, or both. Theaudible  alarm  can  come  either  from  an  optional  audioemitting device disposed in the mobile accessory device100N or (e.g., in embodiments where the mobile accessory device 100N does not include an audio emitting device) from the mobile phone 200, e.g., using a speakerbuilt into the mobile phone 200.[0097] For example, as illustrated, the position of thecomponents of the mobile accessory device 100N relative to a housing 102N may vary. The movable component 4744 is configured to remain in a stowed (e.g., unextended) configuration until the user slide the movablecomponent 4744 away from the stowed configuration relative to the housing 102N. Moving or releasing the mov-', 'EP 4 054 160 A1', 'able component 4744 may activate one or more features.For  example,  in  response  to  the  movable  component4744 being moved, removed (at least in part), shifted, orreleased,  the  position  location  detector  system  154  or210 (see, FIG. 7) may be instructed to activate via thecommunication mechanisms described above. Further,the user’s location may be tracked, e.g., using GPS-likefunctionality built into the mobile accessory device 100Nor the mobile phone 200, during the time period in whichthe movable component 4744 is out of its default positionand thereby the user’s location information may optionally be shared with one or more persons, if desired, e.g.,using  the  communications  capabilities  of  the  mobilephone 200 or the mobile accessory device 100N (e.g.,phone, email, SMS text).[0098] Further, the mobile accessory device 100N mayinclude a slot 4726, a recess, a depression, a texturedarea,  or  a  feature  providing  equivalent  functionality  toease movement of the moveable component 4744, positioned between the movable component 4744 and thehousing 102N. In this regard, in some embodiments theuser input sensor arrangement may be activated, for example, by engaging a fingertip or fingernail or equivalentin  the  slot  4726  and  moving  the  movable  component4744.  Thereby,  based  on  user  input,  activation  of  theuser separation sensor arrangement may be conductedquickly  (e.g., in an unexpected  dangerous situation),  ifnecessary, for example, by moving (at least in part) themovable component 4744.In some embodiments, the movable component[0099]4744, which serves as a user input mechanism, may besupplemented or substituted with one or more other mechanical features configured to provide frictional, grippable, or graspable surface or element to ease releasingor  moving  the movable component 4744. Examples ofsuch mechanical features can include raised or recessedribs, dimples, latches, loops, hooks, projections, textures(e.g., rough, soft, sticky), or combinations of these or other mechanical features that can promote manual operation (e.g., movement or removal) of the movable component 4744.[0100] Alternatively,  or  in  addition,  other  user  inputmechanisms (e.g., switches or buttons) may be used asa user input mechanism to trigger actuation of the mobileaccessory  device  100N.  In  one  such  embodiment,  aswitch 128N (e.g., a button) is arranged on a lateral side4710a of the housing 102N, substantially perpendicularto  a  major  face  surface  4712.  Another  switch  129N  isarranged on a lateral side 4710b of the housing 102N,substantially  perpendicular  to  the  major  face  surface4712 opposite the switch 129N. The switch 128N and/orthe switch 129N may be a depressible button, pressuresensitive, or membrane switches defined as a fingertipsized recess or protrusion having a textured pattern (e.g.,to  facilitate  identification  and  location  of  the  switch  byeither sight or touch).  In use, the  switch 128N  and theswitch  129N  are  pressed  substantially  simultaneously.For example, in the illustrated configuration, a user can', 'squeeze the switch 128N and the switch 129N with twodifferent fingers of one hand in order to activate an alarm,thereby reducing a likelihood of false alarms due to accidental actuation of a single button. The switches maybe used to activate an alarm or non-alarm function thougha predetermined continuous press (e.g., three seconds),through a predetermined  series of presses (e.g.,  threepresses within five seconds), or through a particular sequence of presses (e.g., first pressing the switch 128Nand then the switch 129N), for example, to reduce theoccurrence  of  accidental  activation.  In  some  embodiments, the user input mechanism can be configured todifferentiate  between  and  respond  to  multiple  differentuser inputs. For example, the user can use one predetermined  combination  of buttons and press patterns  toactivate one  response,  and  can  use  another  predetermined combination to active another response. In a morespecific  example, one press the  switch 128N could beused  to  activate  a  texting  application  on  the  mobilephone, two presses could be used to activate a cameraapp  on  the  mobile  phone,  and  three  presses  could  beused to activate one or more of the alarm functions.[0101] Alternatively,  or  in  addition,  other  user  inputmechanisms (e.g., microphones, audio sensors) may beused as a user input mechanism to trigger actuation ofthe mobile accessory device 100N. In one such embodiment, the mobile accessory device 100N can include amicrophone and sound detector circuit (e.g., the sounddetector arrangement 150 and the microphone 152). Thesound detector circuit can be  configured to respond  topredetermined sounds or sound patterns as a user input(e.g.,  voice  commands,  shouts,  alarms,  horns,  sirens,beeps, bells). In some implementations, the sound detector  circuit  can  respond  to  sounds  as  user  inputs bytriggering its internal  alarm  functions,  by  triggering  another device (e.g., activating an application on a mobilephone  to  send  a  message  for  help,  causing  a  mobilephone to emit an audible or visual alarm), or by triggeringan existing function of another device (e.g., activating avoice assistant or other voice-responsive feature of a mobile phone or other device in communication with the mobile accessory device 100N).In  some  implementations,  the  switches  128N[0102]and  129N  may  activate  a  different  type  of  action  thanmay be triggered by separation of the movable component  4744.  For  example,  the  mobile  accessory  device100N  may  respond  to  activation  of  the  switches  128Nand 129N by initiating a silent alarm to alert one or morepredetermined recipients (e.g., causing the mobile phone200 to discretely send a message to a preselected contact), while the mobile accessory device 100N may respond  to  movement  or  partial  removal  of  the  movablecomponent 4744 by initiating an audible alarm and alerting one or more predetermined recipients (e.g., set off asiren and send a message or place a phone call to police).The audible alarm can come either from an optional audioemitting device disposed in the mobile accessory device100N or (e.g., in embodiments where the mobile acces-', 'EP 4 054 160 A1', 'sory device 100N does not include an audio emitting device) from the mobile phone 200, e.g., using a speakerbuilt into the mobile phone 200.In some embodiments, the movable component[0103]4744 (e.g., pull tab) can be configured to be at least partlymoved relative to the housing 102N when subjected toa predetermined force. In some embodiments, the mobileaccessory device 100N can include a wearable component having a lanyard (e.g., the example wearable component  120)  configured  to  mechanically  attach  to  thehousing 102N and/or the movable component 4744 andprovide at least the predetermined force to the movablecomponent based on a pull of upon the lanyard and atleast partly move the movable component relative to thehousing 102N based on the pull.[0104] The mobile accessory device 100N has a rearsurface 4702 substantially parallel to the major face surface 4712. In the illustrated example, an adhesive pad4810 is affixed to the rear surface 4702. In use, the adhesive pad 4801 can be pressed against another surface(e.g.,  the  rear  of  the  mobile  phone  200)  to  attach  themobile accessory device 100N to the other surface.[0105] FIGs. 49A and 49B illustrate a sectional view ofthe example mobile accessory device 100N of FIG. 47.These views are provided to show the configuration andoperation of the movable component 4744 relative to thehousing 102N.[0106] FIG. 49A shows  the mobile accessory device100N in a first configuration (e.g., a triggered configuration).  The  movable  component  4744  is  configured  tomove linearly along the slot 4726. FIG. 49B shows themobile accessory device 100N in a second configuration(e.g., a default, un-triggered configuration). The movablecomponent 4744 can be slid along the slot 4726 (e.g.,inward, toward the center of the housing 102N) to changethe movable component 4744 from the first configurationto the second configuration, and the movable component4744 can be slid along the slot 4726 (e.g., outward, awayfrom the center of the housing 102N) to change the movable component 4744 from the second configuration tothe first configuration (e.g., to trigger an alarm function).As  the  movable  component  4744  is  actuated  betweenthe two configurations, the movable component 4744 activates and releases a switch 4901 (e.g., as part of theuser input sensor 122).[0107] FIG.  50  illustrates  a  perspective  from  view  ofthe example mobile accessory device 100N of FIGs. 47and 49B an example companion mobile accessory device 5000. FIG. 51 illustrates a perspective rear view ofthe  example  mobile  accessory  device  100N  and  companion mobile accessory device 5000. FIGs. 50 and 51shows the mobile accessory device 100N adhered or affixed  to  the  companion  mobile  accessory  device  5000(e.g., a wallet for holding identification cards, credit cards,cash, or the like). In some embodiments, the companionmobile accessory device 5000 can, in turn, be adhered,affixed, or otherwise coupled to the mobile phone 200.[0108] Referring now to FIG. 51. A rear side 5002 of', 'the companion mobile accessory device 5000 includesan adhesive pad 5001. In use, the adhesive pad 5001can be contacted against a surface of the mobile phone200 (e.g., the rear surface 202), or any other appropriatesurface. The companion mobile accessory device 5000defines a cavity 5003. The cavity 5003 is configured toremovably retain one or more wallet-sized cards 5004,such  as  credit  cards, identification  cards  (e.g.,  driver’slicense),  loyalty  cards,  security  access  cards,  foldedcash, or any other appropriately sized items.[0109] FIG. 52 illustrates a partially exploded perspective side view of the example mobile accessory device100N and the companion mobile accessory device 5000.In the illustrated example, the companion mobile accessory device 5000 includes a collection of pins 5201 andtabs  5202,  and  the  mobile  accessory  device  100N  includes a corresponding collection of bores 5203 and slots5204. The pins 5201 and the bores 5203, and the tabs5202 and the slots 5204 are configured to matingly engage to mechanically affix the companion mobile accessory device 5000 to the mobile accessory device 100N.[0110] FIGs.  53  and  54 illustrate an  example  mobileaccessory  device  5300  having  magnetic  features.  Insome embodiments, the mobile accessory device 5300can be a modification of the example mobile accessorydevice 100N of FIGs. 47-49B, or the combination of themobile  accessory  device  100N  and  the  example  companion  mobile  accessory  device  5000  device  of  FIGs.50-52.[0111] The mobile accessory device 5300 includes ahousing 5302, and the housing 5302 includes an attachment component 5310 that is configured to magneticallyengage  corresponding  magnetic  features  provided  onthe rear surface 202 of the mobile phone 200. In someembodiments, the attachment component 5310 can bemade of a magnet, a collection of magnets, a magneticmaterial, or combination of these and any other appropriate  passively  or  actively  magnetic  components  thatcan  magnetically  couple  the  mobile  accessory  device5300 to the mobile phone 200.In  some  embodiments,  the  mobile  accessory[0112]device  5300  can  include  sensors  that  can  determinewhether or not the mobile accessory device 5300 is attached, coupled, or otherwise substantially abutted to themobile phone 200. For example, the mobile accessorydevice 5300 can include a switch (e.g., a momentary pinswitch  that  is  kept  depressed  by  contact  between  themobile accessory device 5300 and the rear surface 202and released when the two become separated), a photonic sensor (e.g., an illuminator and a photodetector thatcan detect  the presence  or  absence  of illumination reflected off the rear surface  202), or  a magnetic  sensor(e.g., a Hall sensor or reed switch in the mobile accessorydevice 5300 that is configured to be activated when mobile accessory device 5300 is moved too far away fromthe magnetic features provided on the rear surface 202).In  some  embodiments,  the  mobile  accessory  device5300 can include a wearable component such as a tether', 'EP 4 054 160 A1', 'or a lanyard (e.g., the example wearable component 120)configured to  mechanically attach  to the  housing 5302and provide at least a predetermined force to the housing5302  based on a pull of  upon the  lanyard  and  at leastpartly separate the mobile accessory device 5300 fromthe mobile phone 200 based on the pull.[0113] FIG.s  55A  and  55B  illustrate  perspective  andside views of an example of a mobile accessory devicebutton 5500 according to an additional example embodiment of the present disclosure. The mobile accessorydevice button  5500 is configured to be attached to themobile phone 200, either directly or indirectly, as will bediscussed further  below. The overall configuration andfeatures of the mobile accessory device button 5500 maybe substantially similar to, or a subset of, that of the mobile accessory device 100 of FIG. 1. However, the mobileaccessory device button 5500 may vary in one or morerespects.[0114] The  mobile  accessory  device  button  5500  includes a housing 5502 and a button 5504 that serves asa  user  input  mechanism,  and  is  configured  to  activatewhen the button 5504 is at least partially moved relativeto the housing 5502, and controller (e.g., the controller112 of FIG. 7, not shown here) disposed in the housing5502 and configured to activate in response to activationof the user input sensor. In the illustrated example, thehousing 5502 and the button 5504 are configured with agenerally convex (e.g., domed) shape.[0115] Activation of the controller can cause an audiblealarm, or cause a software application to be executed onthe mobile phone  200,  or both. The audible alarm cancome either from an optional audio emitting device disposed  in  the  mobile  accessory  device  button  5500  or(e.g., in embodiments where the mobile accessory device button 5500 does not include an audio emitting device) from the mobile phone 200, e.g., using a speakerbuilt into the mobile phone 200. Alternatively, or in addition,  other  user  input  mechanisms  (e.g.,  microphones,audio sensors) may be used as a user input mechanismto trigger actuation of the mobile accessory device button5500.[0116] A rear side 5506 of the mobile accessory devicebutton 5500 includes an adhesive pad 5508. In use, theadhesive pad 5001 can be contacted against a surfaceof the mobile phone 200 (e.g., the rear surface 202), orany other appropriate surface. For example, the mobileaccessory device button 5500 can be affixed, engaged,adhered, or other otherwise coupled atop a one-handedphone holder that is attached to the mobile phone 200.In some embodiments, the mobile accessory device button  5500  can  include  magnetic,  adhesive,  and/or  mechanical features to enable attachment, adherence, affixment, engagement, and/or coupling of the mobile accessory device button 5500, directly or indirectly, to themobile phone 200.[0117] FIG.s  56A  and  56B  illustrate  perspective  andside views of an example of a mobile accessory devicebutton 5600 according to an additional example embod-', 'iment of the present  disclosure. The  mobile accessorydevice button 5600  is configured to be attached  to themobile phone 200, either directly or indirectly, as will bediscussed  further below.  The  overall  configuration andfeatures of the mobile accessory device button 5600 maybe substantially similar to, or a subset of, that of the mobile accessory device 100 of FIG. 1. However, the mobileaccessory device button 5600 may vary in one or morerespects.[0118] The  mobile  accessory  device  button  5600  includes a housing 5602 and a button 5604 that serves asa  user  input  mechanism,  and  is  configured  to  activatewhen the button 5604 is at least partially moved relativeto the housing 5602, and controller (e.g., the controller112 of FIG. 7, not shown here) disposed in the housing5602 and configured to activate in response to activationof the user input sensor. In the illustrated example, thehousing 5602 and the button 5604 are configured with agenerally concave (e.g., scalloped, indented, recessed)shape.[0119] Activation of the controller can cause an audiblealarm, or cause a software application to be executed onthe mobile  phone 200, or both.  The audible  alarm  cancome either from an optional audio emitting device disposed  in  the  mobile  accessory  device  button  5600  or(e.g., in embodiments where the mobile accessory device button 5600 does not include an audio emitting device) from the mobile phone 200, e.g., using a speakerbuilt into the mobile phone 200. Alternatively, or in addition,  other  user  input  mechanisms  (e.g.,  microphones,audio sensors) may be used as a user input mechanismto trigger actuation of the mobile accessory device button5600.[0120] A rear side 5606 of the mobile accessory devicebutton 5600 includes an adhesive pad 5608. In use, theadhesive pad 5001 can be contacted against a surfaceof the mobile phone 200 (e.g., the rear surface 202), orany other appropriate surface. For example, the mobileaccessory device button 5600 can be affixed, engaged,adhered, or other otherwise coupled atop a one-handedphone holder that is attached to the mobile phone 200.In some embodiments, the mobile accessory device button  5600  can  include  magnetic,  adhesive,  and/or  mechanical features to enable attachment, adherence, affixment, engagement, and/or coupling of the mobile accessory device button 5600, directly or indirectly, to themobile phone 200.[0121] FIG. 57 is a flow chart of an example process5700  using  an  example  mobile  accessory  device.  Insome  implementations,  the  process  5700  can  be  performed using one or more of the example mobile deviceaccessories 100A-100N an5 5300-5600  of FIGs.  1-23,and  25-35,  the  personal  safety  device  300  of  FIG.  23,the mobile accessory device 100M of FIGs. 37a-43, themobile accessory device 100N of FIGs. 47-52, the mobileaccessory device 5300 of FIGs. 53-54, and the mobileaccessory device buttons 5500 and 5600 of FIG.s 55A56B.', 'EP 4 054 160 A1', '[0122] At an option step 5710, an attachment surfaceof a housing of a mobile accessory device is engaged toa mobile device. For example, the surface 4801 of thehousing 102N may be configured to engage the rear surface 202 of the mobile phone 200. In another example,the attachment component 5310 shown in FIG. 53 canbe used to secure (e.g., magnetically couple) the mobileaccessory device 5300 to the mobile phone 200.[0123] At 5720, a user input of the mobile accessorydevice is received. For example, one or a combinationor a pattern of the switches 128N, 129N may have beenpressed by a user. In another example, the movable component 4744 may have been actuated or partly movedby a user. In another example, the button 5504 may bepressed by a user.[0124] At 5730, a user input sensor detects that, basedon the received user input, the mobile accessory devicehas been actuated. For example, the user input sensor122  can  determine  that  the  movable  component  4744has been moved, removed (at least partially), released,or shifted, or that the switch 128N and/or the button 129Nhas been pressed.In  some  embodiments, the  process 5700 can[0125]include detecting a mechanical separation of the housingand a lanyard affixed to a wearable component, the lanyard  having  a  predetermined  length  and  mechanicallyconnecting the wearable component to the housing, thelanyard being mechanically separable from the housingwhen  distance  between  the  wearable  component  andthe housing exceeds the predetermined length. For example, the movable component 4744 can be connectedto the wearable component 120, and the user input sensor 122 can determine that the wearable component 120has caused the movable component 4744 to move or atbe at least partly removed from the housing 102N.[0126] At  5740,  a  device  function  is  activated basedon detecting that the user input has been actuated. Forexample, the controller 112 of FIG. 7 can be activated.In some embodiments, activating the device function caninclude  transmitting  an  alarm  signal;  and  wherein  theprocess 5700 can also include receiving, by mobile device, the alarm signal, and sending, by the mobile deviceand in response to the receiving the alarm signal, a predetermined  communication  to  one  or  more  predefinedrecipients. For example, the controller 112 of FIG. 7 canactivate  the communication interface 134 to communicate with the mobile phone 200. The mobile phone 200may have a software application installed and executingthereupon, and the software application can be configured to react to the communication from the mobile accessory device 100M to cause the mobile phone to communicate  with  one  or  more  predetermined  recipients,and/or to emit an audible alarm or other sound. For example, the software application may be configured to initiate a call, send a text message, email, media file, mediastream, location information (e.g., GPS data), capturedaudio and/or video, or any other appropriate informationto one or more contacts previously identified by the user', '(e.g., family member, friend, neighbor, doctor, nurse, caregiver,  welfare  official,  emergency  services,  911).  Insome embodiments, the device function can be any appropriate circuit and/or mechanism that is configured fortaking a predetermined action in response to a trigger,and does not necessarily require nor preclude that thealarm  device is  itself capable  of  generating an audiblealarm.In  some  embodiments,  activating  the  device[0127]function can include activating an audio output component disposed within the housing and configured to emitan audible alert when activated. For example, the mobileaccessory device 100N can include the audio output device 114 that can emit a siren, noise, prerecorded or synthesized spoken words or other sounds, or any other appropriate sound that is sufficiently loud enough to attractthe  attention  of  other  nearby  persons  and/or  repel  anattacker. In some embodiments, activating the alarm device can include activating a visual output configured toemit an audible alert when activated. For example, themobile accessory device 100N can include the light output device 116 that can emit a light or strobe to attractthe  attention  of  other  nearby  persons  and/or  repel  anattacker.In  some  embodiments,  activating  the  device[0128]function can include  activating a  non-alarm  function  ofthe  device.  For  example,  the  mobile  accessory  device100N can be configured to respond to activation by communicating with the mobile phone 200. The mobile devicecan be configured (e.g., with an application executing onthe mobile phone 200) to receive the communication andrespond by activating a function of the mobile phone 200(e.g., opening an app, taking a photo, triggering an alarm,activating  a  voice  assistant  into  a  standby  or  listeningmode).In another configuration, the mobile accessory[0129]device need not be configured to be physically attachableto the mobile device, but rather may be implemented asa standalone unit that can be carried or worn by a user(e.g., as a wallet attachment or insert, key fob, bracelet,or the like), and which maintains a wireless communication connection between the accessory and the mobiledevice. In this configuration, other than the lack of physical attachment, the accessory can be designed and implemented to have any or all of the same features and/orfunctionality as the configuration in which the accessoryis designed to be attached to the mobile device, as described above.[0130] Although a few implementations have been described in detail above, other modifications are possible.For example, the logic flows depicted in the figures donot require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. In addition, other stepsmay be provided, or steps may be eliminated, from thedescribed flows, and other components may be addedto, or removed from, the described systems.
