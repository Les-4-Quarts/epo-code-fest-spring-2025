    "    Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants an analysis linking the provided text to SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being. First, I need to understand what the text is about. It's a technical description of a medical device component, specifically a connector mechanism in a surgical stapling instrument. The key points are about ensuring proper electrical connections between the jaw member and the cartridge assembly to provide specifications like staple size, which is crucial for the device's functionality during surgery.\n",

    "    Now, how does this relate to SDG 3? SDG 3 focuses on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being. The text's relevance here is that the device is used in medical procedures, which directly impact patient health outcomes. By ensuring the device works correctly, it contributes to safer surgeries, reducing complications and improving patient recovery. The connector mechanism's reliability is essential for accurate information transfer, which is part of the device's safety and effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Looking at the citations, I need to find parts of the text that mention the device's role in medical procedures. For example, in [description number 16], it says the connector mechanism provides specifications to the handle assembly, which affects the surgery's outcome. Another part in [description number 20] talks about the connector members being beveled for proper engagement, ensuring the device functions correctly during use. These details are crucial for the device's reliability, which in turn supports good health outcomes.\n",

    "    I need to make sure not to mention other SDGs. Even though the device might relate to innovation or industry (SDG 9), the focus here is strictly on health.
