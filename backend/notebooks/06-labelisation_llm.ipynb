      "Erreur : Pour EP4098900A1, To provide a rotation transmission state switching device having a more simplified configuration. The rotation transmission state switching device comprises a clutch device comprising a first rotating member having a first-rotating-member-side engaging portion, a second rotating member having a second-rotating-member-side engaging portion, a third rotating member having a third-rotating-member-side engaging portion; and an engaging element having an engaging-element-side first engaging portion that engages with the first-rotating-member-side engaging portion, an engaging-element-side second engaging portion that engages with the second-rotating-member-side engaging portion, and an engaging-element-side third engaging portion that engages with the third-rotating-member-side engaging portion; and a restriction device configured so as to be able to switch between a state where rotation of the first rotating member is allowed and a state where rotation of the first rotating member is restricted; torque transmission between the second rotating member and the third rotating member being allowed when rotation of the first rotating member is allowed by the restriction device, whereas torque transmission between the second rotating member and the third rotating member is not possible when rotation of the first rotating member is prevented by the restriction device. 1: The present invention relates to a transmission state switching device that is, for example, incorporated between a drive source and a rotating shaft in order to perform switching so that it is possible or not possible to transmit torque between the drive source and the rotating shaft. 2: In response to the trend of consumption reduction of fossil fuel in recent years, research on electric automobiles has progressed, and the electric automobiles have been partially implemented. As described in JP H09-226394 (A ), for example, a drive unit for electric automobiles includes an electric motor, a gear type speed-reduction mechanism, and a differential gear. When the electric motor is electrically energized to rotate an output shaft of the electric motor, rotation torque of the output shaft is increased by the speed-reduction mechanism, and then is transmitted to the differential gear. Then, the rotation torque is distributed to left and right drive wheels by the differential gear. 3: [Patent Literature 1] JP H09-226394 (A ) 4: The drive unit for electric automobiles described in JP H09-226394 (A ) has room for improvement from the following aspects. For example, when a hybrid automobile in which this drive unit for electric automobiles is incorporated is traveling only by an engine while the electric motor is stopped, rotation of drive wheels is applied to the output shaft of the electric motor with the speed of the rotation increased by the speed-reduction mechanism. Due to this, it is possible to cause such a problem that the electric motor functions as an electric generator, and thus an excessive reverse electromotive voltage is applied to a drive circuit of the electric motor. 5: In order to solve problems as described above, it is considered that by providing a clutch between the electric motor and the drive wheels in a drive system, when the electric motor is stopped, the electric motor and the drive wheels will be separated so as to prevent torque from being transmitted between the drive wheels and the electric motor. However, in this case, because the clutch needs an actuator for switching between a connection state and a disconnection state between the electric motor and the drive wheels while the electric motor and the drive wheels remain rotating, there is a possibility that the structure of the device and control of connection and disconnection of the clutch are complicated. In addition, there is a possibility that a shock caused by connection of the clutch gives a driver a sense of incongruity and an unpleasant feeling. 6: In view of the circumstances described above, an object of the present invention is to provide a rotation transmission state switching device having a more simplified configuration. 7: A rotation transmission state switching device of one aspect of the present invention includes a clutch device and a restriction device. 8: The clutch device includes a first rotating member having a first-rotating-member-side engaging portion, a second rotating member having a second-rotating-member-side engaging portion, a third rotating member having a third-rotating-member-side engaging portion, and an engaging element having an engaging-element-side first engaging portion that engages with the first-rotating-member-side engaging portion, an engaging-element-side second engaging portion that engages with the second-rotating-member-side engaging portion, and an engaging-element-side third engaging portion that engages with the third-rotating-member-side engaging portion. 9: The restriction device is configured so as to be able to switch between a state where rotation of the first rotating member is allowed and a state where rotation of the first rotating member is restricted. 10: In the rotation transmission state switching device of one aspect of the present invention, the restriction device may be configured by a braking device that is provided between a fixed portion that does not rotate even in use and the first rotating member, and that switches between a state where rotation of the first rotating member with respect to the fixed portion is allowed and a state where rotation of the first rotating member with respect to the fixed portion is prevented. 11: Alternatively, the restriction device may be configured by an electric motor. 12: In the rotation transmission state switching device of one aspect of the present invention, torque transmission between the second rotating member and the third rotating member is allowed when rotation of the first rotating member is allowed by the restriction device, whereas torque transmission between the second rotating member and the third rotating member is not possible when rotation of the first rotating member is prevented by the restriction device. 13: The clutch device may include a biasing member configured to elastically bias the engaging element in a direction in which the third-rotating-member-side engaging portion and the engaging-element-side third engaging portion engage with each other. 14: The third rotating member may have the third-rotating-member-side engaging portion on an inner circumferential surface thereof. In this case, the engaging element has the engaging-element-side second engaging portion on an inner side surface in a radial direction thereof, and has the engaging-element-side third engaging portion on an outer side surface in the radial direction thereof. Furthermore, the first-rotating-member-side engaging portion is arranged on the inside in the radial direction of the third-rotating-member-side engaging portion, and the second-rotating-member-side engaging portion is arranged on the inside in the radial direction of the third-rotating-member-side engaging portion. 15: In this case, the engaging element may be configured by a pair of engaging elements that is arranged so as to sandwich the second-rotating-member-side engaging portion by inner side surfaces in the radial direction thereof from outsides in the radial direction. 16: The engaging element may include an engaging element main body having the engaging-element-side second engaging portion, the engaging-element-side third engaging portion, and a swinging support portion that is positioned closer to the third-rotating-member-side engaging portion than the engaging-element-side first engaging portion with respect to a direction of movement of the engaging-element-side third engaging portion toward or away from the third-rotating-member-side engaging portion, and a link member having the engaging-element-side first engaging portion, and a swinging supported member that is supported by the swinging support portion so as to be able to swing. 17: The engaging element main body may include a pair of main body plates that has plate-side engaging portions configuring the engaging-element-side second engaging portion, the pair of main body plates being arranged so as to overlap each other with respect to an axial direction of the third-rotating-member-side engaging portion, and being connected to each other, and a swinging support shaft that constitutes the swinging support portion, the swinging support shaft being supported by the pair of main body plates on both side portions in the axial direction thereof. 18: In this case, the link member may be arranged between the pair of main body plates. 19: The engaging element main body may include an intermediate plate that is sandwiched and held between the pair of main body plates. 20: The third rotating member may have a torque input/output portion on an outer circumferential surface thereof, the torque input/output portion being configured to input and/or output torque between an output shaft of a drive source such as an electric motor and an engine and a rotating shaft. The torque input/output portion may be configured, for example, by a gear portion in which recess portions and convex portions are alternately arranged on an entire circumference thereof so as to mesh with a gear, a pulley portion for laying a belt across, or a sprocket portion for laying a chain across. 21: The rotation transmission state switching device of one aspect of the present invention may be used by being incorporated in a drive system in which rotation torque of the drive source is transmitted to a drive wheel. 22: By one aspect of the present invention, provided is a rotation transmission state switching device having a more simplified structure by which a manufacture cost can be suppressed low. 23: FIG. 1 is a schematic view illustrating a drive system for automobiles in which a rotation transmission state switching device of a first example of an embodiment of the present invention is incorporated.

In the following description, a rotation transmission state switching device of this example is incorporated in a drive system for automobiles. However, applications of the rotation transmission state switching device of the present invention are not limited thereto. 25: As illustrated in FIG. 1 , in automobiles, output torque of a drive source 1 is transmitted to drive wheels (not shown) through a torque transmission member such as a differential gear. The drive source 1 is configured by an engine and/or an electric motor. The drive source 1 has an output shaft 2, and a drive-side gear 3 provided in the tip-end portion of the output shaft 2. 26: The drive system for automobiles of this example includes the drive source 1, a rotating shaft 4 connected to the drive wheels so that torque transmission is possible, and a rotation transmission state switching device 5 disposed between the drive source 1 and the rotating shaft 4. The rotation transmission state switching device 5 of this example has a function to perform switching so that it is possible or not possible to transmit torque between the drive source 1 and the rotating shaft 4, and includes a clutch device 6, and a braking device 7 as a restriction device. 27: The clutch device 6 of this example includes a first rotating member 8, a second rotating member 9, a third rotating member 10, an engaging element 11, and a biasing member 12. Note that, in the following description with respect to the clutch device 6, unless specified otherwise, an axial direction, a radial direction, and a circumferential direction refer to the axial direction, the radial direction, and the circumferential direction of the clutch device 6. In this example, as illustrated in FIG. 2 and the like, the axial direction, the radial direction, and the circumferential direction of the clutch device 6 coincide with the axial direction, the radial direction, and the circumferential direction of the first rotating member 8, and coincide with the axial direction, the radial direction, and the circumferential direction of the second rotating member 9 and the third rotating member 10. In regard to the clutch device 6 of this example, one side in the axial direction is the right side in FIGS. 2 , 4 , 5 , 10 , 13 , 14 , and 16 to 19 , and the other side in the axial direction is the left side in FIGS. 2 , 4 , 5 , 10 , 13 , 14 , and 16 to 19 . 28: As illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5 , the first rotating member 8 has a first shaft portion 13 having a columnar shape, a pair of arm portions 14, and a pair of first-rotating-member-side engaging portions 15. The pair of arm portions 14 extend toward opposite sides in the radial direction to each other from the end portion on the other side in the axial direction of the first shaft portion 13. Each of the pair of arm portions 14 has a support hole 16 as a through hole in the axial direction in the intermediate portion in the radial direction thereof. Each of the pair of first-rotating-member-side engaging portions 15 is configured by a columnar pin. The end portion on the one side in the axial direction of each first-rotating-member-side engaging portion 15 is internally press-fitted and fixed to the support hole 16 of each arm portion 14. In this state, the pair of first-rotating-member-side engaging portions 15 extend toward the other side in the axial direction from the pair of arm portions 14. Note that the first rotating member may be formed integrally n'a pas été trouvé.\n"
