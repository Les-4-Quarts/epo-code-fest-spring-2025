      "[297] Label: SDG9 | Score: 0.127 | Text: Ninth, the guide protrusion for guiding the coupling protrusion to the second coupling surface outward of the constraining protrusion is formed on the second coupling surface, and the guide protrusions are formed on the both sides of the second coupling surface facing each other around the internal space of the second case. The guide protrusion is formed with the slanted face declined outwardly of the second coupling surface.\n",
      "[298] Label: SDG9 | Score: 0.136 | Text: Accordingly, the coupling protrusion may be accurately guided by the slanted face of the guide protrusion to the second coupling surface to be welded outward of the constraining protrusion. That is, the coupling protrusion is guided to the correct position of the second coupling surface by the guide protrusion, so that the stable welding may be achieved.\n"
