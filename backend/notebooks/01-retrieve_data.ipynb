      "PatentDescription: ['SODIUM CHANNEL INHIBITORS AND METHODS OF DESIGNING SAME CLAIM OF PRIORITY [0001] This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to U.S. provisional application serial no.63/236,594, filed on August 24, 2021, which application is incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND [0002] The present invention relates to organic compounds useful for therapy in a mammal, particularly a human, and in particular to inhibitors of sodium channel (e.g., NaV1.7) that are useful for treating sodium channel-mediated diseases or conditions, such as pain, as well as other diseases and conditions associated with the modulation of sodium channels. The invention further includes methods of designing organic compounds that inhibit the NaV1.7 channel based on atom-resolution structures thereof, such as obtained by cryogenic electron microscopy (“Cryo- EM”, or “cryoEM”). [0003] Voltage-gated sodium channels are transmembrane proteins that initiate action potentials in nerve, muscle and other electrically excitable cells, and are a necessary component of normal sensation, emotions, thoughts and movements (Catterall, W.A., Nature (2001), 409, 988- 990). These channels contain a highly processed alpha subunit associated with auxiliary beta subunits. The pore-forming alpha subunit is sufficient for channel function, but the kinetics and voltage dependence of channel gating are in part modified by the beta subunits (Goldin et al, Neuron (2000), 28, 365–368). Electrophysiological recording, biochemical purification, and molecular cloning have identified ten different sodium channel alpha subunits and four beta subunits (Yu, F.H., et al, Sci. STKE (2004), 253; Yu, F.H., et al, Neurosci. (2003), 20:7577-85). [0004] The sodium channel family of proteins has been extensively studied and shown to be involved in a number of vital body functions. Research in this area has identified variants of the alpha subunits that result in major changes in channel function and activities, which can ultimately lead to major pathophysiological conditions. The members of this family of proteins are denoted NaV1.1 to NaV1.9. However, until now, crystal structures of the binding site of sufficient resolution to permit study and design of inhibitor molecules were not available. [0005] NaV1.7 is a tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channel encoded by the gene SCN9A. Human NaV1.7 was first cloned from neuroendocrine cells (Klugbauer, N., et al, 1995 EMBO J., 14 (6): 1084-90) and rat NaV1.7 was cloned from a pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line (Toledo-Aral, J. J., et al., Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. USA (1997), 94:1527–1532) and from rat dorsal root ganglia (Sangameswaran, L., et al., (1997), J. Biol. Chem., 272 (23): 14805-9). NaV1.7 is expressed primarily in the peripheral nervous system, especially nocieptors and olfactory neurons and sympathetic neurons. The inhibition, or blocking, of NaV1.7 has been shown to result in analgesic activity. Knockout of NaV1.7 expression in a subset of sensory neurons that are predominantly nociceptive results in resistance to inflammatory pain (Nassar, et al., op. cit.). Likewise, loss of function mutations in humans results in congenital indifference to pain (CIP), in which the individuals are resistant to both inflammatory and neuropathic pain (Cox, J.J., et al., Nature (2006);444:894-898; Goldberg, Y.P., et al., Clin. Genet. (2007);71:311-319). Conversely, gain of function mutations in NaV1.7 have been established in two human heritable pain conditions, primary erythromelalgia and familial rectal pain, (Yang, Y., et al., J. Med. Genet. (2004), 41(3):171-4). In addition, a single nucleotide polymorphism (R1150W) that has very subtle effects on the time- and voltage-dependence of channel gating has large effects on pain perception (Estacion, M., et al., 2009. Ann Neurol.66: 862-6; Reimann, F., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci USA (2010), 107: 5148-53). About 10% of the patients with a variety of pain conditions have the allele conferring greater sensitivity to pain and thus might be more likely to respond to block of NaV1.7. Because NaV1.7 is expressed in both sensory and sympathetic neurons, one might expect that enhanced pain perception would be accompanied by cardiovascular abnormalities such as hypertension, but no correlation has been reported. Thus, both the CIP mutations and SNP analysis suggest that human pain responses are more sensitive to changes in NaV1.7 currents than are perturbations of autonomic function. [0006] Inhibitors of NaV1.7 can act through several mechanisms of action: pore binding such as via a local anesthetic, e.g., TTX, STX; peptide voltage sensor domain (VSD) binders such as peptide toxins; and small molecule VSD4 binders, such as aryl- and acylsulfonamides as have previously been identified. Efforts to develop isoform selective NaV1.7 inhibitors have largely focused on VSD4 domain binders. [0007] Sodium channel blockers have been shown to be useful in the treatment of pain, (see, e.g., Wood, J.N., et al, J. Neurobiol. (2004), 61(1), 55-71. Genetic and functional studies have provided evidence to support that activity of NaV1.7 as a major contributor to pain signalling in mammals. (See Hajj, et al. Nature Reviews Neuroscience; 2013, vol 14, 49-62; and Lee, et al. Cell, 2014, vol 157; 1-12). Presently, there are a limited number of effective sodium channel blockers for the treatment of pain with a minimum of adverse side effects which are currently in the clinic. Thus there remains a need for selective voltage-gated sodium channel modulators (e.g., modulators of NaV1.7) that are useful for the treatment of pain. However, efforts to improve upon existing chemical matter via structure-based drug design have been complicated by the recalcitrance of the channel toward X-ray crystallographic co-structure determination. SUMMARY [0008] In one aspect the present invention provides novel compounds having sodium channel blocking activity that are useful for the treatment of pain.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Definitions [0127] As used herein, the term “alkyl\", by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise stated, a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon radical, having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e., C1-8means one to eight carbons). Examples of alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n- heptyl, n-octyl, and the like. [0128] The term “alkoxy” is used in its conventional sense, and refers to an alkyl group attached to the remainder of the molecule via an oxygen atom (“oxy”). [0129] The term “alkylthio” is used in its conventional sense, and refers to an alkyl group attached to the remainder of the molecule via a sulfur atom. [0130] The terms “halo” by itself or as part of another substituent, mean, unless otherwise stated, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. [0131] The term “haloalkyl” refers to an alkyl that is substituted with one or more (e.g.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) halo groups. For example the term includes an alkyl group having 1-6 carbon atoms that is substituted with one or more halo groups. Non-limiting examples of the term C1-C6haloalkyl include fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, chloromethyl, and 2,2,2- trifluoroethyl. [0132] The term “(haloalkyl)thio” refers to an alkyl that is substituted with one or more (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) halo groups and is attached to the remainder of the molecule via a sulfur atom. [0133] The term “halocycloalkyl” refers to a cycloalkyl that is substituted with one or more (e.g.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) halo groups. For example the term includes a cycloalkyl group having 3-6 carbon atoms that is substituted with one or more halo groups. Non-limiting examples of the term C1-C6halocycloalkyl include 1-fluorocyclopropyl. [0134] The term “aryl” as used herein refers to a single all carbon aromatic ring or a multiple condensed all carbon ring system wherein at least one of the rings is aromatic. For example, in certain embodiments, an aryl group has 6 to 20 carbon atoms, 6 to 14 carbon atoms, or 6 to 12 carbon atoms. Aryl includes a phenyl radical. Aryl also includes multiple condensed ring systems (e.g., ring systems comprising 2, 3 or 4 rings) having about 9 to 20 carbon atoms in which at least one ring is aromatic and wherein the other rings may be aromatic or not aromatic (i.e., carbocycle). Such multiple condensed ring systems are optionally substituted with one or more (e.g., 1, 2 or 3) oxo groups on any carbocycle portion of the multiple condensed ring system. The rings of the multiple condensed ring system can be connected to each other via fused, spiro and bridged bonds when allowed by valency requirements. It is to be understood that the point of attachment of a multiple condensed ring system, as defined above, can be at any position of the ring system including an aromatic or a carbocycle portion of the ring. Non-limiting examples of aryl groups include, but are not limited to, phenyl, indenyl, naphthyl, 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydronaphthyl, anthracenyl, and the like. [0135] The term “(aryl)alkyl” as used herein refers to an aryl group that is attached through an alkyl group (e.g., benzyl or phenethyl). [0136] The term “carbocycle” or “carbocyclyl” refers to a single saturated (i.e., cycloalkyl) or a single partially unsaturated (e.g., cycloalkenyl, cycloalkadienyl, etc.) all carbon ring having 3 to 7 carbon atoms (i.e., (C3-C7)carbocycle). The term “carbocycle” or “carbocyclyl” also includes multiple condensed, saturated and partially unsaturated all carbon ring systems (e.g., ring systems comprising 2, 3 or 4 carbocyclic rings). Accordingly, carbocycle includes multicyclic carbocyles such as a bicyclic carbocycles (e.g., bicyclic carbocycles having about 6 to 20 or 6 to 12 carbon atoms such as bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane and bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane), and polycyclic carbocycles (e.g tricyclic and tetracyclic carbocycles with up to about 20 carbon atoms). The rings of the multiple condensed ring system can be connected to each other via fused, spiro and bridged bonds when allowed by valency requirements. For example, multicyclic carbocyles can be connected to each other via a single carbon atom to form a spiro connection (e.g., spiropentane, spiro[4,5]decane, etc), via two adjacent carbon atoms to form a fused connection (e.g., carbocycles such as decahydronaphthalene, norsabinane, norcarane) or via two non-adjacent carbon atoms to form a bridged connection (e.g., norbornane, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, etc). The “carbocycle” or “carbocyclyl” can also be optionally substituted with one or more (e.g., 1, 2 or 3) oxo groups. In one embodiment the term carbocycle includes a C3-12carbocycle. In one embodiment the term carbocycle includes a C3-8carbocycle. In one embodiment the term carbocycle includes a C3-6carbocycle. In one embodiment the term carbocycle includes a C3-5carbocycle. Non-limiting examples of carbocycles include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, 1-cyclopent-1-enyl, 1- cyclopent-2-enyl, 1-cyclopent-3-enyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohex-1-enyl, 1-cyclohex-2-enyl, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, pinane, adamantane, norborene, spirocyclic C5-12alkane, and 1-cyclohex-3- enyl. In one embodiment the term “cycloalkyl” refers to a single saturated all carbon ring having 3 to 8 carbon atoms. Non-limiting examples of carbocycles include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl. [0137] The term “(C3-8cycloalkyl)C1-8alkyl” refers to a (C3-8cycloalkyl) group that is attached through an alkyl group (e.g., cyclopropylmethyl or 2-cyclopropylethyl). [0138] The term “heteroaryl” as used herein refers to a single aromatic ring that has at least one atom other than carbon in the ring, wherein the atom is selected from the group consisting of oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur; “heteroaryl” also includes multiple condensed ring systems that have at least one such aromatic ring, which multiple condensed ring systems are further described below. Thus, “heteroaryl” includes single aromatic rings of from about 1 to 6 carbon atoms and about 1-4 heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur. The sulfur and nitrogen atoms may also be present in an oxidized form provided the ring is aromatic. Exemplary heteroaryl ring systems include but are not limited to pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, oxazolyl or furyl. “Heteroaryl” also includes multiple condensed ring systems (e.g., ring systems comprising 2, 3 or 4 rings) wherein a heteroaryl group, as defined above, is condensed with one or more rings selected from heteroaryls (to form for example a naphthyridinyl such as 1,8-naphthyridinyl), heterocycles, (to form for example a 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydronaphthyridinyl such as 1,2,3,4- tetrahydro-1,8-naphthyridinyl), carbocycles (to form for example 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinolyl) and aryls (to form for example indazolyl) to form the multiple condensed ring system. Thus, a heteroaryl (a single aromatic ring or multiple condensed ring system) has about 1-20 carbon atoms and about 1-6 heteroatoms within the heteroaryl ring. A heteroaryl (a single aromatic ring or multiple condensed ring system) can also have about 5 to 20 or about 5 to 15 or about 5 to 10 members within the heteroaryl ring. Such multiple condensed ring systems may be optionally substituted with one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3 or 4) oxo groups on the carbocycle or heterocycle portions of the condensed ring. The rings of the multiple condensed ring system can be connected to each other via fused, spiro and bridged bonds when allowed by valency requirements. It is to be understood that the individual rings of the multiple condensed ring system may be connected in any order relative to one another. It is also to be understood that the point of attachment of a multiple condensed ring system (as defined above for a heteroaryl) can be at any position of the multiple condensed ring system including a heteroaryl, heterocycle, aryl or carbocycle portion of the multiple condensed ring system. It is also to be understood that the point of attachment for a heteroaryl or heteroaryl multiple condensed ring system can be at any suitable atom of the heteroaryl or heteroaryl multiple condensed ring system including a carbon atom and a heteroatom (e.g., a nitrogen). Exemplary heteroaryls include but are not limited to pyridyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrazolyl, thienyl, indolyl, imidazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, furyl, oxadiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzoxazolyl, indazolyl, quinoxalyl, quinazolyl, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroisoquinolinyl benzofuranyl, benzimidazolyl, thianaphthenyl, pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridinyl, quinazolinyl-4(3H)-one, triazolyl, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-indazole and 3b,4,4a,5-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopropa[3,4]cyclo- penta[1,2- c]pyrazole. In one embodiment the term “heteroaryl” refers to a single aromatic ring containing at least one heteroatom. For example, the term includes 5-membered and 6-membered monocyclic aromatic rings that include one or more heteroatoms. Non-limiting examples of heteroaryl include but are not limited to pyridyl, furyl, thiazole, pyrimidine, oxazole, and thiadiazole. [0139] The term “(heteroaryl)C1-8alkyl” refers to a (heteroaryl) group that is attached through an alkyl group (e.g., pyrid-2-ylmethyl or 2-(pyrid-2-yl)ethyl). [0140] The term “heterocycloalkyl,” “heterocyclic,” or “heterocycle” refers to a saturated or partially unsaturated ring system radical having from 3-10 ring atoms (e.g., 3-10 membered heterocycloalkyl is a heterocycloalkyl radical with 3-10 ring atoms, a C2-9heterocycloalkyl is a heterocycloalkyl having 3-10 ring atoms with 2-9 ring atoms being carbon) that contain from one to five heteroatoms independently selected from N, O, and S, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, nitrogen atom(s) are optionally quaternized, as ring atoms. Unless otherwise stated, a “heterocycloalkyl,” “heterocyclic,” or “heterocycle” ring can be a monocyclic, a bicyclic, spirocyclic or a polycylic ring system. Non limiting examples of “heterocycloalkyl,” “heterocyclic,” or “heterocycle” rings include pyrrolidine, piperidine, N-methylpiperidine, imidazolidine, pyrazolidine, butyrolactam, valerolactam, imidazolidinone, hydantoin, dioxolane, phthalimide, piperidine, pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione, 1,4-dioxane, morpholine, thiomorpholine, thiomorpholine-S-oxide, thiomorpholine-S,S-oxide, piperazine, pyran, pyridone, 3-pyrroline, thiopyran, pyrone, tetrahydrofuran, tetrhydrothiophene, quinuclidine, tropane, 2- azaspiro[3.3]heptane, (1R,5S)-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane, (1s,4s)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, (1R,4R)-2-oxa-5-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and the like A “heterocycloalkyl,” “heterocyclic,” or “heterocycle” group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through one or more ring carbons or heteroatoms. A “heterocycloalkyl,” “heterocyclic,” or “heterocycle” can include mono- and poly-halogenated variants thereof. [0141] The term “(heterocycloalkyl)C1-8alkyl” refers to a (heterocycloalkyl) group that is attached through an alkyl group (e.g., pyrrolidin-2-ylmethyl or 2-( pyrrolidine-2-yl)ethyl) [0142] As used herein, the term “heteroatom” is meant to include oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S) and silicon (Si). The nitrogen and sulfur can be in an oxidized form when feasible. [0143] As used herein, the term “chiral” refers to molecules which have the property of non- superimposability of the mirror image partner, while the term “achiral” refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner. [0144] As used herein, the term “stereoisomers” refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution, but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space. [0145] As used herein a wavy line “ “ that intersects a bond in a chemical structure indicates the point of attachment of the bond that the wavy bond intersects in the chemical structure to the remainder of a molecule. [0146] \"Diastereomer” refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers can separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography. [0147] \"Enantiomers” refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non- superimposable mirror images of one another. [0148] Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms (1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., “Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds”, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. The compounds of the invention can contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention, including but not limited to, diastereomers, enantiomers and atropisomers, as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and l or (+) and (-) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (-) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer can also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which can occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms “racemic mixture” and “racemate” refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity. [0149] When a bond in a compound formula herein is drawn in a non-stereochemical manner (e.g. flat), the atom to which the bond is attached includes all stereochemical possibilities. When a bond in a compound formula herein is drawn in a defined stereochemical manner (e.g. bold, bold-wedge, dashed or dashed-wedge), it is to be understood that the atom to which the stereochemical bond is attached is enriched in the absolute stereoisomer depicted unless otherwise noted. In one embodiment, the compound may be at least 51% the absolute stereoisomer depicted. In another embodiment, the compound may be at least 80% the absolute stereoisomer depicted. In another embodiment, the compound may be at least 90% the absolute stereoisomer depicted. In another embodiment, the compound may be at least 95% the absolute stereoisomer depicted. In another embodiment, the compound may be at least 97% the absolute stereoisomer depicted. In another embodiment, the compound may be at least 98% the absolute stereoisomer depicted. In another embodiment, the compound may be at least 99% the absolute stereoisomer depicted. [0150] As used herein, the term “tautomer” or “tautomeric form” refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons. [0151] As used herein, the term “solvate” refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a compound of the invention. Examples of solvents that form solvates include, but are not limited to, water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and ethanolamine. The term “hydrate” refers to the complex where the solvent molecule is water. [0152] As used herein, the term “protecting group” refers to a substituent that is commonly employed to block or protect a particular functional group on a compound. For example, an “amino-protecting group” is a substituent attached to an amino group that blocks or protects the amino functionality in the compound. Suitable amino-protecting groups include acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ) and 9- fluorenylmethylenoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). Similarly, a “hydroxy-protecting group” refers to a substituent of a hydroxy group that blocks or protects the hydroxy functionality. Suitable protecting groups include acetyl and silyl. A “carboxy-protecting group” refers to a substituent of the carboxy group that blocks or protects the carboxy functionality. Common carboxy-protecting groups include phenylsulfonylethyl, cyanoethyl, 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl, 2- (trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl, 2-(p-toluenesulfonyl)ethyl, 2-(p-nitrophenylsulfenyl)ethyl, 2- (diphenylphosphino)-ethyl, nitroethyl and the like. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see P.G.M. Wuts and T.W. Greene, Greene\\'s Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis 4<th>edition, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 2006. [0153] As used herein, the term “mammal” includes, but is not limited to, humans, mice, rats, guinea pigs, monkeys, dogs, cats, horses, cows, pigs, and sheep. [0154] As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” is meant to include salts of the active compounds which are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the particular substituents found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of salts derived from pharmaceutically-acceptable inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc and the like. Salts derived from pharmaceutically-acceptable organic bases include salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, including substituted amines, cyclic amines, naturally-occurring amines and the like, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, N,N\\'-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2- diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N- ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine and the like. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, for example, Berge, S. M., et al., “Pharmaceutical Salts”, Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 1977, 66, 1-19). Certain specific compounds of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts. [0155] The neutral forms of the compounds can be regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to the parent form of the compound for the purposes of the present invention. [0156] In addition to salt forms, the present invention provides compounds which are in a prodrug form. As used herein the term “prodrug” refers to those compounds that readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds of the present invention. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the present invention by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example, prodrugs can be slowly converted to the compounds of the present invention when placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent. [0157] Prodrugs of the invention include compounds wherein an amino acid residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more (e.g., two, three or four) amino acid residues, is covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino, hydroxy or carboxylic acid group of a compound of the present invention. The amino acid residues include but are not limited to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids commonly designated by three letter symbols and also includes phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, phosphotyrosine, 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, demosine, isodemosine, gamma-carboxyglutamate, hippuric acid, octahydroindole-2-carboxylic acid, statine, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, penicillamine, ornithine, 3-methylhistidine, norvaline, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, citrulline, homocysteine, homoserine, methyl- alanine, para-benzoylphenylalanine, phenylglycine, propargylglycine, sarcosine, methionine sulfone and tert-butylglycine. [0158] Additional types of prodrugs are also encompassed. For instance, a free carboxyl group of a compound of the invention can be derivatized as an amide or alkyl ester. As another example, compounds of this invention comprising free hydroxy groups can be derivatized as prodrugs by converting the hydroxy group into a group such as, but not limited to, a phosphate ester, hemisuccinate, dimethylaminoacetate, or phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyl group, as outlined in Fleisher, D. et al., (1996) Improved oral drug delivery: solubility limitations overcome by the use of prodrugs Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 19:115. Carbamate prodrugs of hydroxy and amino groups are also included, as are carbonate prodrugs, sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and (acyloxy)ethyl ethers, wherein the acyl group can be an alkyl ester optionally substituted with groups including, but not limited to, ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities, or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above, are also encompassed. Prodrugs of this type are described in J. Med. Chem., (1996), 39:10. More specific examples include replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as (C1-6)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1-((C1-6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, 1-methyl-1-((C1-6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, (C1-6)alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl, N-(C1-6)alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl, succinoyl, (C1-6)alkanoyl, alpha-amino(C1-4)alkanoyl, arylacyl and alpha-aminoacyl, or alpha-aminoacyl-alpha-aminoacyl, where each alpha-aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L-amino acids, P(O)(OH)2, -P(O)(O(C1-6)alkyl)2or glycosyl (the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate). [0159] For additional examples of prodrug derivatives, see, for example, a) Design of Prodrugs, edited by H. Bundgaard, (Elsevier, 1985) and Methods in Enzymology, Vol.42, p.309- 396, edited by K. Widder, et al. (Academic Press, 1985); b) A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, edited by Krogsgaard-Larsen and H. Bundgaard, Chapter 5 “Design and Application of Prodrugs,” by H. Bundgaard p.113-191 (1991); c) H. Bundgaard, Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 8:1-38 (1992); d) H. Bundgaard, et al., Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 77:285 (1988); and e) N. Kakeya, et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 32:692 (1984), each of which is specifically incorporated herein by reference. [0160] Additionally, the present invention provides for metabolites of compounds of the invention. As used herein, a “metabolite” refers to a product produced through metabolism in the body of a specified compound or salt thereof. Such products can result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, deamidation, esterification, deesterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound. [0161] Metabolite products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabelled (e.g.,<14>C or<3>H) isotope of a compound of the invention, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g., greater than about 0.5 mg/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g., by MS, LC/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well known to those skilled in the art. The metabolite products, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the compounds of the invention. Pharmaceutical Compositions and Administration [0162] In addition to one or more of the compounds provided above (or stereoisomers, geometric isomers, tautomers, solvates, metabolites, isotopes, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or prodrugs thereof), the invention also provides for compositions and medicaments comprising a compound of the invention and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient. The compositions of the invention can be used to selectively inhibit NaV1.7 in patients (e.g, humans). [0163] The term “composition,” as used herein, is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. By “pharmaceutically acceptable” it is meant the carrier, diluent or excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. [0164] In one embodiment, the invention provides for pharmaceutical compositions (or medicaments) comprising a compound as described herein, and its stereoisomers, geometric isomers, tautomers, solvates, metabolites, isotopes, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or prodrugs thereof) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient. In another embodiment, the invention provides for preparing compositions (or medicaments) comprising compounds of the invention. In another embodiment, the invention provides for administering a compound of the invention or a and compositions comprising a compound of the invention to a patient (e.g., a human patient) in need thereof. [0165] Compositions are formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The effective amount of the compound to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to inhibit NaV1.7 activity as required to prevent or treat the undesired disease or disorder, such as for example, pain. For example, such amount may be below the amount that is toxic to normal cells, or the mammal as a whole. [0166] In one example, the therapeutically effective amount of the compound of the invention administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 0.01-100 mg/kg, alternatively about e.g., 0.1 to 20 mg/kg of patient body weight per day, with the typical initial range of compound used being 0.3 to 15 mg/kg/day. The daily does is, in certain embodiments, given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to six times a day, or in sustained release form. In the case of a 70kg adult human, the total daily dose will generally be from about 7mg to about 1,400mg. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimal therapeutic response. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day, preferably once or twice per day. [0167] The compounds of the present invention may be administered in any convenient administrative form, e.g., tablets, powders, capsules, solutions, dispersions, suspensions, syrups, sprays, suppositories, gels, emulsions, patches, etc. Such compositions may contain components conventional in pharmaceutical preparations, e.g., diluents, carriers, pH modifiers, sweeteners, bulking agents, and further active agents. [0168] The compounds of the invention may be administered by any suitable means, including oral, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal, transdermal, parenteral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural and intranasal, and, if desired for local treatment, intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intraocular, intralesional or subcutaneous administration. [0169] The compositions comprising compounds as described herein or an embodiment thereof are normally formulated in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice as a pharmaceutical composition. A typical formulation is prepared by mixing a compound of the present invention and a diluent, carrier or excipient. Suitable diluents, carriers and excipients are well known to those skilled in the art and are described in detail in, e.g., Ansel, Howard C., et al., Ansel’s Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, 2004; Gennaro, Alfonso R., et al. Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, 2000; and Rowe, Raymond C. Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients. Chicago, Pharmaceutical Press, 2005. The formulations may also include one or more buffers, stabilizing agents, surfactants, wetting agents, lubricating agents, emulsifiers, suspending agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opaquing agents, glidants, processing aids, colorants, sweeteners, perfuming agents, flavoring agents, diluents and other known additives to provide an elegant presentation of the drug (i.e., a compound of the present invention or pharmaceutical composition thereof) or aid in the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical product (i.e., medicament). [0170] Suitable carriers, diluents and excipients are well known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as carbohydrates, waxes, water soluble and/or swellable polymers, hydrophilic or hydrophobic materials, gelatin, oils, solvents, water and the like. The particular carrier, diluent or excipient used will depend upon the means and purpose for which a compound of the present invention is being applied. Solvents are generally selected based on solvents recognized by persons skilled in the art as safe (GRAS) to be administered to a mammal. In general, safe solvents are non-toxic aqueous solvents such as water and other non-toxic solvents that are soluble or miscible in water. Suitable aqueous solvents include water, ethanol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols (e.g., PEG 400, PEG 300), etc. and mixtures thereof. The formulations can also include one or more buffers, stabilizing agents, surfactants, wetting agents, lubricating agents, emulsifiers, suspending agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opaquing agents, glidants, processing aids, colorants, sweeteners, perfuming agents, flavoring agents and other known additives to provide an elegant presentation of the drug (i.e., a compound of the present invention or pharmaceutical composition thereof) or aid in the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical product (i.e., medicament). [0171] Acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients and stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, PLURONICS™ or polyethylene glycol (PEG). A active pharmaceutical ingredient of the invention (e.g., a compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the invention) can also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly- (methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy: Remington the Science and Practice of Pharmacy (2005) 21<st>Edition, Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philidelphia, PA. [0172] Sustained-release preparations of a compound can be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing a compound as described herein, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinyl alcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Patent No.3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., Biopolymers 22:547, 1983), non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate (Langer et al., J. Biomed. Mater. Res.15:167, 1981), degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate) and poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988A). Sustained release compositions also include liposomally entrapped compounds, which can be prepared by methods known per se (Epstein et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.82:3688, 1985; Hwang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.77:4030, 1980; U.S. Patent Nos.4,485,045 and 4,544,545; and EP 102,324A). Ordinarily, the liposomes are of the small (about 200-800 Angstroms) unilamelar type in which the lipid content is greater than about 30 mol % cholesterol, the selected proportion being adjusted for the optimal therapy. [0173] The formulations include those suitable for the administration routes detailed herein. The formulations can conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and can be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy: Remington the Science and Practice of Pharmacy (2005) 21<st>Edition, Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philidelphia, PA. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. [0174] In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers, diluents or excipients or finely divided solid carriers, diluents or excipients, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product. A typical formulation is prepared by mixing a compound of the present invention and a carrier, diluent or excipient. The formulations can be prepared using conventional dissolution and mixing procedures. For example, the bulk drug substance (i.e., compound of the present invention or stabilized form of the compound (e.g., complex with a cyclodextrin derivative or other known complexation agent) is dissolved in a suitable solvent in the presence of one or more of the excipients described above. A compound of the present invention is typically formulated into pharmaceutical dosage forms to provide an easily controllable dosage of the drug and to enable patient compliance with the prescribed regimen. [0175] In one example, compounds as described herein may be formulated by mixing at ambient temperature at the appropriate pH, and at the desired degree of purity, with physiologically acceptable carriers, i.e., carriers that are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed into a galenical administration form. The pH of the formulation depends mainly on the particular use and the concentration of compound, but preferably ranges anywhere from about 3 to about 8. In one example, a compound of of the invention is formulated in an acetate buffer, at pH 5. In another embodiment, a compound of the invention is sterile. The compound may be stored, for example, as a solid or amorphous composition, as a lyophilized formulation or as an aqueous solution. [0176] Formulations of a compound as described herein suitable for oral administration can be prepared as discrete units such as pills, capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of the invention. [0177] Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered active ingredient moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets can optionally be coated or scored and optionally are formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therefrom. [0178] Tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules, syrups or elixirs can be prepared for oral use. Formulations of a compound as described herein intended for oral use can be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions can contain one or more agents including sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents, in order to provide a palatable preparation. Tablets containing the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipient which are suitable for manufacture of tablets are acceptable. These excipients can be, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium or sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, such as maize starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, such as starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. Tablets can be uncoated or can be coated by known techniques including microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax can be employed. [0179] An example of a suitable oral administration form is a tablet containing about 1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 25mg, 30mg, 50mg, 80mg, 100mg, 150mg, 250mg, 300mg and 500mg of the compound of the invention compounded with about 90-30mg anhydrous lactose, about 5-40mg sodium croscarmellose, about 5-30mg polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) K30, and about 1-10mg magnesium stearate. The powdered ingredients are first mixed together and then mixed with a solution of the PVP. The resulting composition can be dried, granulated, mixed with the magnesium stearate and compressed to tablet form using conventional equipment. An example of an aerosol formulation can be prepared by dissolving the compound, for example 5-400mg, of the invention in a suitable buffer solution, e.g. a phosphate buffer, adding a tonicifier, e.g. a salt such sodium chloride, if desired. The solution may be filtered, e.g., using a 0.2 micron filter, to remove impurities and contaminants. [0180] For treatment of the eye or other external tissues, e.g., mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s) in an amount of, for example, 0.075 to 20% w/w. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredient can be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients can be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base. If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base can include a polyhydric alcohol, i.e., an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol (including PEG 400) and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations can desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethyl sulfoxide and related analogs. [0181] The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention can be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase can comprise merely an emulsifier, it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations. Emulsifiers and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the invention include Tween® 60, Span® 80, cetostearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono-stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate. [0182] In one aspect of topical applications, it is desired to administer an effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention to target area, e.g., skin surfaces, mucous membranes, and the like, which are adjacent to peripheral neurons which are to be treated. This amount will generally range from about 0.0001 mg to about 1 g of a compound of the invention per application, depending upon the area to be treated, whether the use is diagnostic, prophylactic or therapeutic, the severity of the symptoms, and the nature of the topical vehicle employed. A preferred topical preparation is an ointment, wherein about 0.001 to about 50 mg of active ingredient is used per cc of ointment base. The pharmaceutical composition can be formulated as transdermal compositions or transdermal delivery devices (\"patches\"). Such compositions include, for example, a backing, active compound reservoir, a control membrane, liner and contact adhesive. Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous pulsatile, or on demand delivery of the compounds of the present invention as desired. [0183] Aqueous suspensions of a compound as described herein contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, croscarmellose, povidone, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous suspension can also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin. [0184] Formulations of a compound as described herein can be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension can be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butanediol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water, Ringer\\'s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils can conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid can likewise be used in the preparation of injectables. [0185] The amount of active ingredient that can be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a time-release formulation intended for oral administration to humans can contain approximately 1 to 1000 mg of active material compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which can vary from about 5 to about 95% of the total compositions (weight:weight). The pharmaceutical composition can be prepared to provide easily measurable amounts for administration. For example, an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion can contain from about 3 to 500 μg of the active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30 mL/hr can occur. [0186] Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which can contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non- aqueous sterile suspensions which can include suspending agents and thickening agents. [0187] Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredient. The active ingredient is preferably present in such formulations in a concentration of about 0.5 to 20% w/w, for example about 0.5 to 10% w/w, for example about 1.5% w/w. [0188] Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier. [0189] Formulations for rectal administration can be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate. [0190] Formulations suitable for intrapulmonary or nasal administration have a particle size for example in the range of 0.1 to 500 microns (including particle sizes in a range between 0.1 and 500 microns in increments microns such as 0.5, 1, 30 microns, 35 microns, etc.), which is administered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage or by inhalation through the mouth so as to reach the alveolar sacs. Suitable formulations include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient. Formulations suitable for aerosol or dry powder administration can be prepared according to conventional methods and can be delivered with other therapeutic agents such as compounds heretofore used in the treatment of disorders as described below. [0191] The formulations can be packaged in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and can be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water, for injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient. [0192] When the binding target is located in the brain, certain embodiments of the invention provide for a compound as described herein to traverse the blood-brain barrier. Certain neurodegenerative diseases are associated with an increase in permeability of the blood-brain barrier, such that a compound of of the invention can be readily introduced to the brain. When the blood-brain barrier remains intact, several art-known approaches exist for transporting molecules across it, including, but not limited to, physical methods, lipid-based methods, and receptor and channel-based methods. [0193] Physical methods of transporting a compound as described herein across the blood- brain barrier include, but are not limited to, circumventing the blood- brain barrier entirely, or by creating openings in the blood-brain barrier. [0194] Circumvention methods include, but are not limited to, direct injection into the brain (see, e.g., Papanastassiou et al., Gene Therapy 9:398-406, 2002), interstitial infusion/convection- enhanced delivery (see, e.g., Bobo et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.91 :2076-2080, 1994), and implanting a delivery device in the brain (see, e.g., Gill et al., Nature Med.9:589-595, 2003; and Gliadel Wafers™, Guildford Pharmaceutical). Methods of creating openings in the barrier include, but are not limited to, ultrasound (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No.2002/0038086), osmotic pressure (e.g., by administration of hypertonic mannitol (Neuwelt, E. A., Implication of the Blood-Brain Barrier and its Manipulation, Volumes 1 and 2, Plenum Press, N.Y., 1989)), and permeabilization by, e.g., bradykinin or permeabilizer A-7 (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos.5,112,596, 5,268,164, 5,506,206, and 5,686,416). [0195] Lipid-based methods of transporting a compound as described herein across the blood- brain barrier include, but are not limited to, encapsulating the a compound as described herein in liposomes that are coupled to antibody binding fragments that bind to receptors on the vascular endothelium of the blood- brain barrier (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0025313), and coating a compound as described herein in low-density lipoprotein particles (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No.2004/0204354) or apolipoprotein E (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No.2004/0131692). [0196] Receptor and channel-based methods of transporting a compound as described herein across the blood-brain barrier include, but are not limited to, using glucocorticoid blockers to increase permeability of the blood-brain barrier (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos.2002/0065259, 2003/0162695, and 2005/0124533); activating potassium channels (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No.2005/0089473), inhibiting ABC drug transporters (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No.2003/0073713); coating a compound as described herein with a transferrin and modulating activity of the one or more transferrin receptors (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No.2003/0129186), and cationizing the antibodies (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No.5,004,697). [0197] For intracerebral use, in certain embodiments, the compounds can be administered continuously by infusion into the fluid reservoirs of the CNS, although bolus injection may be acceptable. The inhibitors can be administered into the ventricles of the brain or otherwise introduced into the CNS or spinal fluid. Administration can be performed by use of an indwelling catheter and a continuous administration means such as a pump, or it can be administered by implantation, e.g., intracerebral implantation of a sustained-release vehicle. More specifically, the inhibitors can be injected through chronically implanted cannulas or chronically infused with the help of osmotic minipumps. Subcutaneous pumps are available that deliver proteins through a small tubing to the cerebral ventricles. Highly sophisticated pumps can be refilled through the skin and their delivery rate can be set without surgical intervention. Examples of suitable admin- istration protocols and delivery systems involving a subcutaneous pump device or continuous intracerebroventricular infusion through a totally implanted drug delivery system are those used for the administration of dopamine, dopamine agonists, and cholinergic agonists to Alzheimer\\'s disease patients and animal models for Parkinson\\'s disease, as described by Harbaugh, J. Neural Transm. Suppl.24:271, 1987; and DeYebenes et al, Mov. Disord.2: 143, 1987. [0198] A compound as described herein used in the invention are formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. A compound as described herein need not be, but is optionally formulated with one or more agent currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of a compound of the invention present in the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above. [0199] These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as described herein, or about from 1 to 99% of the dosages described herein, or in any dosage and by any route that is empirically/clinically determined to be appropriate. [0200] For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of a compound as described herein (when used alone or in combination with other agents) will depend on the type of disease to be treated, the properties of the compound, the severity and course of the disease, whether the compound is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient\\'s clinical history and response to the compound, and the discretion of the attending physician. The compound is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 μg/kg to 15 mg/kg (e.g., 0.1 mg/kg-10 mg/kg) of compound can be an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 μg kg to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment would generally be sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of a compound of the invention would be in the range from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg. Thus, one or more doses of about 0.5 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, 4.0 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg (or any combination thereof) may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently, e.g., every week or every three weeks (e.g., such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty, or, e.g., about six doses of the antibody). An initial higher loading dose, followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg/kg, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg kg of the compound. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays. [0201] Other typical daily dosages might range from, for example, about 1 g/kg to up to 100 mg/kg or more (e.g., about 1 μg kg to 1 mg/kg, about 1 μg/kg to about 5 mg/kg, about 1 mg kg to 10 mg/kg, about 5 mg/kg to about 200 mg/kg, about 50 mg/kg to about 150 mg/mg, about 100 mg/kg to about 500 mg/kg, about 100 mg/kg to about 400 mg/kg, and about 200 mg/kg to about 400 mg/kg), depending on the factors mentioned above. Typically, the clinician will administer a compound until a dosage is reached that results in improvement in or, optimally, elimination of, one or more symptoms of the treated disease or condition. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional assays. One or more agent provided herein may be administered together or at different times (e.g., one agent is administered prior to the administration of a second agent). One or more agent may be administered to a subject using different techniques (e.g., one agent may be administered orally, while a second agent is administered via intramuscular injection or intranasally). One or more agent may be administered such that the one or more agent has a pharmacologic effect in a subject at the same time. Alternatively, one or more agent may be administered, such that the pharmacological activity of the first administered agent is expired prior the administration of one or more secondarily administered agents (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4 secondarily administered agents).
