      "PatentDescription: ['SODIUM CHANNEL INHIBITORS AND METHODS OF DESIGNING SAME CLAIM OF PRIORITY [0001] This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to U.S. provisional application serial no.63/236,594, filed on August 24, 2021, which application is incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND [0002] The present invention relates to organic compounds useful for therapy in a mammal, particularly a human, and in particular to inhibitors of sodium channel (e.g., NaV1.7) that are useful for treating sodium channel-mediated diseases or conditions, such as pain, as well as other diseases and conditions associated with the modulation of sodium channels. The invention further includes methods of designing organic compounds that inhibit the NaV1.7 channel based on atom-resolution structures thereof, such as obtained by cryogenic electron microscopy (“Cryo- EM”, or “cryoEM”). [0003] Voltage-gated sodium channels are transmembrane proteins that initiate action potentials in nerve, muscle and other electrically excitable cells, and are a necessary component of normal sensation, emotions, thoughts and movements (Catterall, W.A., Nature (2001), 409, 988- 990). These channels contain a highly processed alpha subunit associated with auxiliary beta subunits. The pore-forming alpha subunit is sufficient for channel function, but the kinetics and voltage dependence of channel gating are in part modified by the beta subunits (Goldin et al, Neuron (2000), 28, 365–368). Electrophysiological recording, biochemical purification, and molecular cloning have identified ten different sodium channel alpha subunits and four beta subunits (Yu, F.H., et al, Sci. STKE (2004), 253; Yu, F.H., et al, Neurosci. (2003), 20:7577-85). [0004] The sodium channel family of proteins has been extensively studied and shown to be involved in a number of vital body functions. Research in this area has identified variants of the alpha subunits that result in major changes in channel function and activities, which can ultimately lead to major pathophysiological conditions. The members of this family of proteins are denoted NaV1.1 to NaV1.9. However, until now, crystal structures of the binding site of sufficient resolution to permit study and design of inhibitor molecules were not available. [0005] NaV1.7 is a tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channel encoded by the gene SCN9A. Human NaV1.7 was first cloned from neuroendocrine cells (Klugbauer, N., et al, 1995 EMBO J., 14 (6): 1084-90) and rat NaV1.7 was cloned from a pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line (Toledo-Aral, J. J., et al., Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. USA (1997), 94:1527–1532) and from rat dorsal root ganglia (Sangameswaran, L., et al., (1997), J. Biol. Chem., 272 (23): 14805-9). NaV1.7 is expressed primarily in the peripheral nervous system, especially nocieptors and olfactory neurons and sympathetic neurons. The inhibition, or blocking, of NaV1.7 has been shown to result in analgesic activity. Knockout of NaV1.7 expression in a subset of sensory neurons that are predominantly nociceptive results in resistance to inflammatory pain (Nassar, et al., op. cit.). Likewise, loss of function mutations in humans results in congenital indifference to pain (CIP), in which the individuals are resistant to both inflammatory and neuropathic pain (Cox, J.J., et al., Nature (2006);444:894-898; Goldberg, Y.P., et al., Clin. Genet. (2007);71:311-319). Conversely, gain of function mutations in NaV1.7 have been established in two human heritable pain conditions, primary erythromelalgia and familial rectal pain, (Yang, Y., et al., J. Med. Genet. (2004), 41(3):171-4). In addition, a single nucleotide polymorphism (R1150W) that has very subtle effects on the time- and voltage-dependence of channel gating has large effects on pain perception (Estacion, M., et al., 2009. Ann Neurol.66: 862-6; Reimann, F., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci USA (2010), 107: 5148-53). About 10% of the patients with a variety of pain conditions have the allele conferring greater sensitivity to pain and thus might be more likely to respond to block of NaV1.7. Because NaV1.7 is expressed in both sensory and sympathetic neurons, one might expect that enhanced pain perception would be accompanied by cardiovascular abnormalities such as hypertension, but no correlation has been reported. Thus, both the CIP mutations and SNP analysis suggest that human pain responses are more sensitive to changes in NaV1.7 currents than are perturbations of autonomic function. [0006] Inhibitors of NaV1.7 can act through several mechanisms of action: pore binding such as via a local anesthetic, e.g., TTX, STX; peptide voltage sensor domain (VSD) binders such as peptide toxins; and small molecule VSD4 binders, such as aryl- and acylsulfonamides as have previously been identified. Efforts to develop isoform selective NaV1.7 inhibitors have largely focused on VSD4 domain binders. [0007] Sodium channel blockers have been shown to be useful in the treatment of pain, (see, e.g., Wood, J.N., et al, J. Neurobiol. (2004), 61(1), 55-71. Genetic and functional studies have provided evidence to support that activity of NaV1.7 as a major contributor to pain signalling in mammals. (See Hajj, et al. Nature Reviews Neuroscience; 2013, vol 14, 49-62; and Lee, et al. Cell, 2014, vol 157; 1-12). Presently, there are a limited number of effective sodium channel blockers for the treatment of pain with a minimum of adverse side effects which are currently in the clinic. Thus there remains a need for selective voltage-gated sodium channel modulators (e.g., modulators of NaV1.7) that are useful for the treatment of pain. However, efforts to improve upon existing chemical matter via structure-based drug design have been complicated by the recalcitrance of the channel toward X-ray crystallographic co-structure determination. SUMMARY [0008] In one aspect the present invention provides novel compounds having sodium channel blocking activity that are useful for the treatment of pain.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Definitions [0127] As used herein, the term “alkyl\", by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise stated, a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon radical, having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e., C1-8means one to eight carbons). Examples of alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n- heptyl, n-octyl, and the like. [0128] The term “alkoxy” is used in its conventional sense, and refers to an alkyl group attached to the remainder of the molecule via an oxygen atom (“oxy”). [0129] The term “alkylthio” is used in its conventional sense, and refers to an alkyl group attached to the remainder of the molecule via a sulfur atom. [0130] The terms “halo” by itself or as part of another substituent, mean, unless otherwise stated, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. [0131] The term “haloalkyl” refers to an alkyl that is substituted with one or more (e.g.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) halo groups. For example the term includes an alkyl group having 1-6 carbon atoms that is substituted with one or more halo groups. Non-limiting examples of the term C1-C6haloalkyl include fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, chloromethyl, and 2,2,2- trifluoroethyl. [0132] The term “(haloalkyl)thio” refers to an alkyl that is substituted with one or more (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) halo groups and is attached to the remainder of the molecule via a sulfur atom. [0133] The term “halocycloalkyl” refers to a cycloalkyl that is substituted with one or more (e.g.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) halo groups. For example the term includes a cycloalkyl group having 3-6 carbon atoms that is substituted with one or more halo groups. Non-limiting examples of the term C1-C6halocycloalkyl include 1-fluorocyclopropyl. [0134] The term “aryl” as used herein refers to a single all carbon aromatic ring or a multiple condensed all carbon ring system wherein at least one of the rings is aromatic. For example, in certain embodiments, an aryl group has 6 to 20 carbon atoms, 6 to 14 carbon atoms, or 6 to 12 carbon atoms. Aryl includes a phenyl radical. Aryl also includes multiple condensed ring systems (e.g., ring systems comprising 2, 3 or 4 rings) having about 9 to 20 carbon atoms in which at least one ring is aromatic and wherein the other rings may be aromatic or not aromatic (i.e., carbocycle). Such multiple condensed ring systems are optionally substituted with one or more (e.g., 1, 2 or 3) oxo groups on any carbocycle portion of the multiple condensed ring system. The rings of the multiple condensed ring system can be connected to each other via fused, spiro and bridged bonds when allowed by valency requirements. It is to be understood that the point of attachment of a multiple condensed ring system, as defined above, can be at any position of the ring system including an aromatic or a carbocycle portion of the ring. Non-limiting examples of aryl groups include, but are not limited to, phenyl, indenyl, naphthyl, 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydronaphthyl, anthracenyl, and the like. [0135] The term “(aryl)alkyl” as used herein refers to an aryl group that is attached through an alkyl group (e.g., benzyl or phenethyl). [0136] The term “carbocycle” or “carbocyclyl” refers to a single saturated (i.e., cycloalkyl) or a single partially unsaturated (e.g., cycloalkenyl, cycloalkadienyl, etc.) all carbon ring having 3 to 7 carbon atoms (i.e., (C3-C7)carbocycle). The term “carbocycle” or “carbocyclyl” also includes multiple condensed, saturated and partially unsaturated all carbon ring systems (e.g., ring systems comprising 2, 3 or 4 carbocyclic rings). Accordingly, carbocycle includes multicyclic carbocyles such as a bicyclic carbocycles (e.g., bicyclic carbocycles having about 6 to 20 or 6 to 12 carbon atoms such as bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane and bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane), and polycyclic carbocycles (e.g tricyclic and tetracyclic carbocycles with up to about 20 carbon atoms). The rings of the multiple condensed ring system can be connected to each other via fused, spiro and bridged bonds when allowed by valency requirements. For example, multicyclic carbocyles can be connected to each other via a single carbon atom to form a spiro connection (e.g., spiropentane, spiro[4,5]decane, etc), via two adjacent carbon atoms to form a fused connection (e.g., carbocycles such as decahydronaphthalene, norsabinane, norcarane) or via two non-adjacent carbon atoms to form a bridged connection (e.g., norbornane, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, etc). The “carbocycle” or “carbocyclyl” can also be optionally substituted with one or more (e.g., 1, 2 or 3) oxo groups. In one embodiment the term carbocycle includes a C3-12carbocycle. In one embodiment the term carbocycle includes a C3-8carbocycle. In one embodiment the term carbocycle includes a C3-6carbocycle. In one embodiment the term carbocycle includes a C3-5carbocycle. Non-limiting examples of carbocycles include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, 1-cyclopent-1-enyl, 1- cyclopent-2-enyl, 1-cyclopent-3-enyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohex-1-enyl, 1-cyclohex-2-enyl, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, pinane, adamantane, norborene, spirocyclic C5-12alkane, and 1-cyclohex-3- enyl. In one embodiment the term “cycloalkyl” refers to a single saturated all carbon ring having 3 to 8 carbon atoms. Non-limiting examples of carbocycles include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl. [0137] The term “(C3-8cycloalkyl)C1-8alkyl” refers to a (C3-8cycloalkyl) group that is attached through an alkyl group (e.g., cyclopropylmethyl or 2-cyclopropylethyl). [0138] The term “heteroaryl” as used herein refers to a single aromatic ring that has at least one atom other than carbon in the ring, wherein the atom is selected from the group consisting of oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur; “heteroaryl” also includes multiple condensed ring systems that have at least one such aromatic ring, which multiple condensed ring systems are further described below. Thus, “heteroaryl” includes single aromatic rings of from about 1 to 6 carbon atoms and about 1-4 heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur. The sulfur and nitrogen atoms may also be present in an oxidized form provided the ring is aromatic. Exemplary heteroaryl ring systems include but are not limited to pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, oxazolyl or furyl. “Heteroaryl” also includes multiple condensed ring systems (e.g., ring systems comprising 2, 3 or 4 rings) wherein a heteroaryl group, as defined above, is condensed with one or more rings selected from heteroaryls (to form for example a naphthyridinyl such as 1,8-naphthyridinyl), heterocycles, (to form for example a 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydronaphthyridinyl such as 1,2,3,4- tetrahydro-1,8-naphthyridinyl), carbocycles (to form for example 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinolyl) and aryls (to form for example indazolyl) to form the multiple condensed ring system. Thus, a heteroaryl (a single aromatic ring or multiple condensed ring system) has about 1-20 carbon atoms and about 1-6 heteroatoms within the heteroaryl ring. A heteroaryl (a single aromatic ring or multiple condensed ring system) can also have about 5 to 20 or about 5 to 15 or about 5 to 10 members within the heteroaryl ring. Such multiple condensed ring systems may be optionally substituted with one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3 or 4) oxo groups on the carbocycle or heterocycle portions of the condensed ring. The rings of the multiple condensed ring system can be connected to each other via fused, spiro and bridged bonds when allowed by valency requirements. It is to be understood that the individual rings of the multiple condensed ring system may be connected in any order relative to one another. It is also to be understood that the point of attachment of a multiple condensed ring system (as defined above for a heteroaryl) can be at any position of the multiple condensed ring system including a heteroaryl, heterocycle, aryl or carbocycle portion of the multiple condensed ring system. It is also to be understood that the point of attachment for a heteroaryl or heteroaryl multiple condensed ring system can be at any suitable atom of the heteroaryl or heteroaryl multiple condensed ring system including a carbon atom and a heteroatom (e.g., a nitrogen). Exemplary heteroaryls include but are not limited to pyridyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrazolyl, thienyl, indolyl, imidazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, furyl, oxadiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzoxazolyl, indazolyl, quinoxalyl, quinazolyl, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroisoquinolinyl benzofuranyl, benzimidazolyl, thianaphthenyl, pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridinyl, quinazolinyl-4(3H)-one, triazolyl, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-indazole and 3b,4,4a,5-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopropa[3,4]cyclo- penta[1,2- c]pyrazole. In one embodiment the term “heteroaryl” refers to a single aromatic ring containing at least one heteroatom. For example, the term includes 5-membered and 6-membered monocyclic aromatic rings that include one or more heteroatoms. Non-limiting examples of heteroaryl include but are not limited to pyridyl, furyl, thiazole, pyrimidine, oxazole, and thiadiazole. [0139] The term “(heteroaryl)C1-8alkyl” refers to a (heteroaryl) group that is attached through an alkyl group (e.g., pyrid-2-ylmethyl or 2-(pyrid-2-yl)ethyl). [0140] The term “heterocycloalkyl,” “heterocyclic,” or “heterocycle” refers to a saturated or partially unsaturated ring system radical having from 3-10 ring atoms (e.g., 3-10 membered heterocycloalkyl is a heterocycloalkyl radical with 3-10 ring atoms, a C2-9heterocycloalkyl is a heterocycloalkyl having 3-10 ring atoms with 2-9 ring atoms being carbon) that contain from one to five heteroatoms independently selected from N, O, and S, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, nitrogen atom(s) are optionally quaternized, as ring atoms. Unless otherwise stated, a “heterocycloalkyl,” “heterocyclic,” or “heterocycle” ring can be a monocyclic, a bicyclic, spirocyclic or a polycylic ring system. Non limiting examples of “heterocycloalkyl,” “heterocyclic,” or “heterocycle” rings include pyrrolidine, piperidine, N-methylpiperidine, imidazolidine, pyrazolidine, butyrolactam, valerolactam, imidazolidinone, hydantoin, dioxolane, phthalimide, piperidine, pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione, 1,4-dioxane, morpholine, thiomorpholine, thiomorpholine-S-oxide, thiomorpholine-S,S-oxide, piperazine, pyran, pyridone, 3-pyrroline, thiopyran, pyrone, tetrahydrofuran, tetrhydrothiophene, quinuclidine, tropane, 2- azaspiro[3.3]heptane, (1R,5S)-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane, (1s,4s)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, (1R,4R)-2-oxa-5-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and the like A “heterocycloalkyl,” “heterocyclic,” or “heterocycle” group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through one or more ring carbons or heteroatoms. A “heterocycloalkyl,” “heterocyclic,” or “heterocycle” can include mono- and poly-halogenated variants thereof. [0141] The term “(heterocycloalkyl)C1-8alkyl” refers to a (heterocycloalkyl) group that is attached through an alkyl group (e.g., pyrrolidin-2-ylmethyl or 2-( pyrrolidine-2-yl)ethyl) [0142] As used herein, the term “heteroatom” is meant to include oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S) and silicon (Si). The nitrogen and sulfur can be in an oxidized form when feasible. [0143] As used herein, the term “chiral” refers to molecules which have the property of non- superimposability of the mirror image partner, while the term “achiral” refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner. [0144] As used herein, the term “stereoisomers” refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution, but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space. [0145] As used herein a wavy line “ “ that intersects a bond in a chemical structure indicates the point of attachment of the bond that the wavy bond intersects in the chemical structure to the remainder of a molecule. [0146] \"Diastereomer” refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers can separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography. [0147] \"Enantiomers” refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non- superimposable mirror images of one another. [0148] Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms (1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., “Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds”, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. The compounds of the invention can contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention, including but not limited to, diastereomers, enantiomers and atropisomers, as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and l or (+) and (-) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (-) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer can also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which can occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms “racemic mixture” and “racemate” refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity. [0149] When a bond in a compound formula herein is drawn in a non-stereochemical manner (e.g. flat), the atom to which the bond is attached includes all stereochemical possibilities. When a bond in a compound formula herein is drawn in a defined stereochemical manner (e.g. bold, bold-wedge, dashed or dashed-wedge), it is to be understood that the atom to which the stereochemical bond is attached is enriched in the absolute stereoisomer depicted unless otherwise noted. In one embodiment, the compound may be at least 51% the absolute stereoisomer depicted. In another embodiment, the compound may be at least 80% the absolute stereoisomer depicted. In another embodiment, the compound may be at least 90% the absolute stereoisomer depicted. In another embodiment, the compound may be at least 95% the absolute stereoisomer depicted. In another embodiment, the compound may be at least 97% the absolute stereoisomer depicted. In another embodiment, the compound may be at least 98% the absolute stereoisomer depicted. In another embodiment, the compound may be at least 99% the absolute stereoisomer depicted. [0150] As used herein, the term “tautomer” or “tautomeric form” refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons. [0151] As used herein, the term “solvate” refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a compound of the invention. Examples of solvents that form solvates include, but are not limited to, water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and ethanolamine. The term “hydrate” refers to the complex where the solvent molecule is water. [0152] As used herein, the term “protecting group” refers to a substituent that is commonly employed to block or protect a particular functional group on a compound. For example, an “amino-protecting group” is a substituent attached to an amino group that blocks or protects the amino functionality in the compound. Suitable amino-protecting groups include acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ) and 9- fluorenylmethylenoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). Similarly, a “hydroxy-protecting group” refers to a substituent of a hydroxy group that blocks or protects the hydroxy functionality. Suitable protecting groups include acetyl and silyl. A “carboxy-protecting group” refers to a substituent of the carboxy group that blocks or protects the carboxy functionality. Common carboxy-protecting groups include phenylsulfonylethyl, cyanoethyl, 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl, 2- (trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl, 2-(p-toluenesulfonyl)ethyl, 2-(p-nitrophenylsulfenyl)ethyl, 2- (diphenylphosphino)-ethyl, nitroethyl and the like. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see P.G.M. Wuts and T.W. Greene, Greene\\'s Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis 4<th>edition, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 2006. [0153] As used herein, the term “mammal” includes, but is not limited to, humans, mice, rats, guinea pigs, monkeys, dogs, cats, horses, cows, pigs, and sheep. [0154] As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” is meant to include salts of the active compounds which are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the particular substituents found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of salts derived from pharmaceutically-acceptable inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc and the like. Salts derived from pharmaceutically-acceptable organic bases include salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, including substituted amines, cyclic amines, naturally-occurring amines and the like, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, N,N\\'-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2- diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N- ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine and the like. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, for example, Berge, S. M., et al., “Pharmaceutical Salts”, Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 1977, 66, 1-19). Certain specific compounds of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts. [0155] The neutral forms of the compounds can be regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to the parent form of the compound for the purposes of the present invention. [0156] In addition to salt forms, the present invention provides compounds which are in a prodrug form. As used herein the term “prodrug” refers to those compounds that readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds of the present invention. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the present invention by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example, prodrugs can be slowly converted to the compounds of the present invention when placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent. [0157] Prodrugs of the invention include compounds wherein an amino acid residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more (e.g., two, three or four) amino acid residues, is covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino, hydroxy or carboxylic acid group of a compound of the present invention. The amino acid residues include but are not limited to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids commonly designated by three letter symbols and also includes phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, phosphotyrosine, 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, demosine, isodemosine, gamma-carboxyglutamate, hippuric acid, octahydroindole-2-carboxylic acid, statine, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, penicillamine, ornithine, 3-methylhistidine, norvaline, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, citrulline, homocysteine, homoserine, methyl- alanine, para-benzoylphenylalanine, phenylglycine, propargylglycine, sarcosine, methionine sulfone and tert-butylglycine. [0158] Additional types of prodrugs are also encompassed. For instance, a free carboxyl group of a compound of the invention can be derivatized as an amide or alkyl ester. As another example, compounds of this invention comprising free hydroxy groups can be derivatized as prodrugs by converting the hydroxy group into a group such as, but not limited to, a phosphate ester, hemisuccinate, dimethylaminoacetate, or phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyl group, as outlined in Fleisher, D. et al., (1996) Improved oral drug delivery: solubility limitations overcome by the use of prodrugs Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 19:115. Carbamate prodrugs of hydroxy and amino groups are also included, as are carbonate prodrugs, sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and (acyloxy)ethyl ethers, wherein the acyl group can be an alkyl ester optionally substituted with groups including, but not limited to, ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities, or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above, are also encompassed. Prodrugs of this type are described in J. Med. Chem., (1996), 39:10. More specific examples include replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as (C1-6)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1-((C1-6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, 1-methyl-1-((C1-6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, (C1-6)alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl, N-(C1-6)alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl, succinoyl, (C1-6)alkanoyl, alpha-amino(C1-4)alkanoyl, arylacyl and alpha-aminoacyl, or alpha-aminoacyl-alpha-aminoacyl, where each alpha-aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L-amino acids, P(O)(OH)2, -P(O)(O(C1-6)alkyl)2or glycosyl (the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate). [0159] For additional examples of prodrug derivatives, see, for example, a) Design of Prodrugs, edited by H. Bundgaard, (Elsevier, 1985) and Methods in Enzymology, Vol.42, p.309- 396, edited by K. Widder, et al. (Academic Press, 1985); b) A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, edited by Krogsgaard-Larsen and H. Bundgaard, Chapter 5 “Design and Application of Prodrugs,” by H. Bundgaard p.113-191 (1991); c) H. Bundgaard, Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 8:1-38 (1992); d) H. Bundgaard, et al., Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 77:285 (1988); and e) N. Kakeya, et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 32:692 (1984), each of which is specifically incorporated herein by reference. [0160] Additionally, the present invention provides for metabolites of compounds of the invention. As used herein, a “metabolite” refers to a product produced through metabolism in the body of a specified compound or salt thereof. Such products can result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, deamidation, esterification, deesterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound. [0161] Metabolite products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabelled (e.g.,<14>C or<3>H) isotope of a compound of the invention, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g., greater than about 0.5 mg/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g., by MS, LC/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well known to those skilled in the art. The metabolite products, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the compounds of the invention. Pharmaceutical Compositions and Administration [0162] In addition to one or more of the compounds provided above (or stereoisomers, geometric isomers, tautomers, solvates, metabolites, isotopes, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or prodrugs thereof), the invention also provides for compositions and medicaments comprising a compound of the invention and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient. The compositions of the invention can be used to selectively inhibit NaV1.7 in patients (e.g, humans). [0163] The term “composition,” as used herein, is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. By “pharmaceutically acceptable” it is meant the carrier, diluent or excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. [0164] In one embodiment, the invention provides for pharmaceutical compositions (or medicaments) comprising a compound as described herein, and its stereoisomers, geometric isomers, tautomers, solvates, metabolites, isotopes, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or prodrugs thereof) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient. In another embodiment, the invention provides for preparing compositions (or medicaments) comprising compounds of the invention. In another embodiment, the invention provides for administering a compound of the invention or a and compositions comprising a compound of the invention to a patient (e.g., a human patient) in need thereof. [0165] Compositions are formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The effective amount of the compound to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to inhibit NaV1.7 activity as required to prevent or treat the undesired disease or disorder, such as for example, pain. For example, such amount may be below the amount that is toxic to normal cells, or the mammal as a whole. [0166] In one example, the therapeutically effective amount of the compound of the invention administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 0.01-100 mg/kg, alternatively about e.g., 0.1 to 20 mg/kg of patient body weight per day, with the typical initial range of compound used being 0.3 to 15 mg/kg/day. The daily does is, in certain embodiments, given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to six times a day, or in sustained release form. In the case of a 70kg adult human, the total daily dose will generally be from about 7mg to about 1,400mg. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimal therapeutic response. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day, preferably once or twice per day. [0167] The compounds of the present invention may be administered in any convenient administrative form, e.g., tablets, powders, capsules, solutions, dispersions, suspensions, syrups, sprays, suppositories, gels, emulsions, patches, etc. Such compositions may contain components conventional in pharmaceutical preparations, e.g., diluents, carriers, pH modifiers, sweeteners, bulking agents, and further active agents. [0168] The compounds of the invention may be administered by any suitable means, including oral, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal, transdermal, parenteral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural and intranasal, and, if desired for local treatment, intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intraocular, intralesional or subcutaneous administration. [0169] The compositions comprising compounds as described herein or an embodiment thereof are normally formulated in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice as a pharmaceutical composition. A typical formulation is prepared by mixing a compound of the present invention and a diluent, carrier or excipient. Suitable diluents, carriers and excipients are well known to those skilled in the art and are described in detail in, e.g., Ansel, Howard C., et al., Ansel’s Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, 2004; Gennaro, Alfonso R., et al. Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, 2000; and Rowe, Raymond C. Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients. Chicago, Pharmaceutical Press, 2005. The formulations may also include one or more buffers, stabilizing agents, surfactants, wetting agents, lubricating agents, emulsifiers, suspending agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opaquing agents, glidants, processing aids, colorants, sweeteners, perfuming agents, flavoring agents, diluents and other known additives to provide an elegant presentation of the drug (i.e., a compound of the present invention or pharmaceutical composition thereof) or aid in the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical product (i.e., medicament). [0170] Suitable carriers, diluents and excipients are well known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as carbohydrates, waxes, water soluble and/or swellable polymers, hydrophilic or hydrophobic materials, gelatin, oils, solvents, water and the like. The particular carrier, diluent or excipient used will depend upon the means and purpose for which a compound of the present invention is being applied. Solvents are generally selected based on solvents recognized by persons skilled in the art as safe (GRAS) to be administered to a mammal. In general, safe solvents are non-toxic aqueous solvents such as water and other non-toxic solvents that are soluble or miscible in water. Suitable aqueous solvents include water, ethanol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols (e.g., PEG 400, PEG 300), etc. and mixtures thereof. The formulations can also include one or more buffers, stabilizing agents, surfactants, wetting agents, lubricating agents, emulsifiers, suspending agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opaquing agents, glidants, processing aids, colorants, sweeteners, perfuming agents, flavoring agents and other known additives to provide an elegant presentation of the drug (i.e., a compound of the present invention or pharmaceutical composition thereof) or aid in the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical product (i.e., medicament). [0171] Acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients and stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, PLURONICS™ or polyethylene glycol (PEG). A active pharmaceutical ingredient of the invention (e.g., a compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the invention) can also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly- (methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy: Remington the Science and Practice of Pharmacy (2005) 21<st>Edition, Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philidelphia, PA. [0172] Sustained-release preparations of a compound can be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing a compound as described herein, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinyl alcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Patent No.3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., Biopolymers 22:547, 1983), non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate (Langer et al., J. Biomed. Mater. Res.15:167, 1981), degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate) and poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988A). Sustained release compositions also include liposomally entrapped compounds, which can be prepared by methods known per se (Epstein et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.82:3688, 1985; Hwang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.77:4030, 1980; U.S. Patent Nos.4,485,045 and 4,544,545; and EP 102,324A). Ordinarily, the liposomes are of the small (about 200-800 Angstroms) unilamelar type in which the lipid content is greater than about 30 mol % cholesterol, the selected proportion being adjusted for the optimal therapy. [0173] The formulations include those suitable for the administration routes detailed herein. The formulations can conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and can be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy: Remington the Science and Practice of Pharmacy (2005) 21<st>Edition, Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philidelphia, PA. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. [0174] In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers, diluents or excipients or finely divided solid carriers, diluents or excipients, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product. A typical formulation is prepared by mixing a compound of the present invention and a carrier, diluent or excipient. The formulations can be prepared using conventional dissolution and mixing procedures. For example, the bulk drug substance (i.e., compound of the present invention or stabilized form of the compound (e.g., complex with a cyclodextrin derivative or other known complexation agent) is dissolved in a suitable solvent in the presence of one or more of the excipients described above. A compound of the present invention is typically formulated into pharmaceutical dosage forms to provide an easily controllable dosage of the drug and to enable patient compliance with the prescribed regimen. [0175] In one example, compounds as described herein may be formulated by mixing at ambient temperature at the appropriate pH, and at the desired degree of purity, with physiologically acceptable carriers, i.e., carriers that are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed into a galenical administration form. The pH of the formulation depends mainly on the particular use and the concentration of compound, but preferably ranges anywhere from about 3 to about 8. In one example, a compound of of the invention is formulated in an acetate buffer, at pH 5. In another embodiment, a compound of the invention is sterile. The compound may be stored, for example, as a solid or amorphous composition, as a lyophilized formulation or as an aqueous solution. [0176] Formulations of a compound as described herein suitable for oral administration can be prepared as discrete units such as pills, capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of the invention. [0177] Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered active ingredient moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets can optionally be coated or scored and optionally are formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therefrom. [0178] Tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules, syrups or elixirs can be prepared for oral use. Formulations of a compound as described herein intended for oral use can be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions can contain one or more agents including sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents, in order to provide a palatable preparation. Tablets containing the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipient which are suitable for manufacture of tablets are acceptable. These excipients can be, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium or sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, such as maize starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, such as starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. Tablets can be uncoated or can be coated by known techniques including microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax can be employed. [0179] An example of a suitable oral administration form is a tablet containing about 1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 25mg, 30mg, 50mg, 80mg, 100mg, 150mg, 250mg, 300mg and 500mg of the compound of the invention compounded with about 90-30mg anhydrous lactose, about 5-40mg sodium croscarmellose, about 5-30mg polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) K30, and about 1-10mg magnesium stearate. The powdered ingredients are first mixed together and then mixed with a solution of the PVP. The resulting composition can be dried, granulated, mixed with the magnesium stearate and compressed to tablet form using conventional equipment. An example of an aerosol formulation can be prepared by dissolving the compound, for example 5-400mg, of the invention in a suitable buffer solution, e.g. a phosphate buffer, adding a tonicifier, e.g. a salt such sodium chloride, if desired. The solution may be filtered, e.g., using a 0.2 micron filter, to remove impurities and contaminants. [0180] For treatment of the eye or other external tissues, e.g., mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s) in an amount of, for example, 0.075 to 20% w/w. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredient can be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients can be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base. If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base can include a polyhydric alcohol, i.e., an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol (including PEG 400) and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations can desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethyl sulfoxide and related analogs. [0181] The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention can be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase can comprise merely an emulsifier, it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations. Emulsifiers and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the invention include Tween® 60, Span® 80, cetostearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono-stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate. [0182] In one aspect of topical applications, it is desired to administer an effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention to target area, e.g., skin surfaces, mucous membranes, and the like, which are adjacent to peripheral neurons which are to be treated. This amount will generally range from about 0.0001 mg to about 1 g of a compound of the invention per application, depending upon the area to be treated, whether the use is diagnostic, prophylactic or therapeutic, the severity of the symptoms, and the nature of the topical vehicle employed. A preferred topical preparation is an ointment, wherein about 0.001 to about 50 mg of active ingredient is used per cc of ointment base. The pharmaceutical composition can be formulated as transdermal compositions or transdermal delivery devices (\"patches\"). Such compositions include, for example, a backing, active compound reservoir, a control membrane, liner and contact adhesive. Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous pulsatile, or on demand delivery of the compounds of the present invention as desired. [0183] Aqueous suspensions of a compound as described herein contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, croscarmellose, povidone, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous suspension can also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin. [0184] Formulations of a compound as described herein can be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension can be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butanediol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water, Ringer\\'s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils can conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid can likewise be used in the preparation of injectables. [0185] The amount of active ingredient that can be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a time-release formulation intended for oral administration to humans can contain approximately 1 to 1000 mg of active material compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which can vary from about 5 to about 95% of the total compositions (weight:weight). The pharmaceutical composition can be prepared to provide easily measurable amounts for administration. For example, an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion can contain from about 3 to 500 μg of the active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30 mL/hr can occur. [0186] Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which can contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non- aqueous sterile suspensions which can include suspending agents and thickening agents. [0187] Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredient. The active ingredient is preferably present in such formulations in a concentration of about 0.5 to 20% w/w, for example about 0.5 to 10% w/w, for example about 1.5% w/w. [0188] Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier. [0189] Formulations for rectal administration can be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate. [0190] Formulations suitable for intrapulmonary or nasal administration have a particle size for example in the range of 0.1 to 500 microns (including particle sizes in a range between 0.1 and 500 microns in increments microns such as 0.5, 1, 30 microns, 35 microns, etc.), which is administered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage or by inhalation through the mouth so as to reach the alveolar sacs. Suitable formulations include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient. Formulations suitable for aerosol or dry powder administration can be prepared according to conventional methods and can be delivered with other therapeutic agents such as compounds heretofore used in the treatment of disorders as described below. [0191] The formulations can be packaged in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and can be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water, for injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient. [0192] When the binding target is located in the brain, certain embodiments of the invention provide for a compound as described herein to traverse the blood-brain barrier. Certain neurodegenerative diseases are associated with an increase in permeability of the blood-brain barrier, such that a compound of of the invention can be readily introduced to the brain. When the blood-brain barrier remains intact, several art-known approaches exist for transporting molecules across it, including, but not limited to, physical methods, lipid-based methods, and receptor and channel-based methods. [0193] Physical methods of transporting a compound as described herein across the blood- brain barrier include, but are not limited to, circumventing the blood- brain barrier entirely, or by creating openings in the blood-brain barrier. [0194] Circumvention methods include, but are not limited to, direct injection into the brain (see, e.g., Papanastassiou et al., Gene Therapy 9:398-406, 2002), interstitial infusion/convection- enhanced delivery (see, e.g., Bobo et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.91 :2076-2080, 1994), and implanting a delivery device in the brain (see, e.g., Gill et al., Nature Med.9:589-595, 2003; and Gliadel Wafers™, Guildford Pharmaceutical). Methods of creating openings in the barrier include, but are not limited to, ultrasound (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No.2002/0038086), osmotic pressure (e.g., by administration of hypertonic mannitol (Neuwelt, E. A., Implication of the Blood-Brain Barrier and its Manipulation, Volumes 1 and 2, Plenum Press, N.Y., 1989)), and permeabilization by, e.g., bradykinin or permeabilizer A-7 (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos.5,112,596, 5,268,164, 5,506,206, and 5,686,416). [0195] Lipid-based methods of transporting a compound as described herein across the blood- brain barrier include, but are not limited to, encapsulating the a compound as described herein in liposomes that are coupled to antibody binding fragments that bind to receptors on the vascular endothelium of the blood- brain barrier (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0025313), and coating a compound as described herein in low-density lipoprotein particles (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No.2004/0204354) or apolipoprotein E (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No.2004/0131692). [0196] Receptor and channel-based methods of transporting a compound as described herein across the blood-brain barrier include, but are not limited to, using glucocorticoid blockers to increase permeability of the blood-brain barrier (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos.2002/0065259, 2003/0162695, and 2005/0124533); activating potassium channels (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No.2005/0089473), inhibiting ABC drug transporters (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No.2003/0073713); coating a compound as described herein with a transferrin and modulating activity of the one or more transferrin receptors (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No.2003/0129186), and cationizing the antibodies (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No.5,004,697). [0197] For intracerebral use, in certain embodiments, the compounds can be administered continuously by infusion into the fluid reservoirs of the CNS, although bolus injection may be acceptable. The inhibitors can be administered into the ventricles of the brain or otherwise introduced into the CNS or spinal fluid. Administration can be performed by use of an indwelling catheter and a continuous administration means such as a pump, or it can be administered by implantation, e.g., intracerebral implantation of a sustained-release vehicle. More specifically, the inhibitors can be injected through chronically implanted cannulas or chronically infused with the help of osmotic minipumps. Subcutaneous pumps are available that deliver proteins through a small tubing to the cerebral ventricles. Highly sophisticated pumps can be refilled through the skin and their delivery rate can be set without surgical intervention. Examples of suitable admin- istration protocols and delivery systems involving a subcutaneous pump device or continuous intracerebroventricular infusion through a totally implanted drug delivery system are those used for the administration of dopamine, dopamine agonists, and cholinergic agonists to Alzheimer\\'s disease patients and animal models for Parkinson\\'s disease, as described by Harbaugh, J. Neural Transm. Suppl.24:271, 1987; and DeYebenes et al, Mov. Disord.2: 143, 1987. [0198] A compound as described herein used in the invention are formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. A compound as described herein need not be, but is optionally formulated with one or more agent currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of a compound of the invention present in the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above. [0199] These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as described herein, or about from 1 to 99% of the dosages described herein, or in any dosage and by any route that is empirically/clinically determined to be appropriate. [0200] For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of a compound as described herein (when used alone or in combination with other agents) will depend on the type of disease to be treated, the properties of the compound, the severity and course of the disease, whether the compound is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient\\'s clinical history and response to the compound, and the discretion of the attending physician. The compound is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 μg/kg to 15 mg/kg (e.g., 0.1 mg/kg-10 mg/kg) of compound can be an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 μg kg to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment would generally be sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of a compound of the invention would be in the range from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg. Thus, one or more doses of about 0.5 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, 4.0 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg (or any combination thereof) may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently, e.g., every week or every three weeks (e.g., such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty, or, e.g., about six doses of the antibody). An initial higher loading dose, followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg/kg, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg kg of the compound. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays. [0201] Other typical daily dosages might range from, for example, about 1 g/kg to up to 100 mg/kg or more (e.g., about 1 μg kg to 1 mg/kg, about 1 μg/kg to about 5 mg/kg, about 1 mg kg to 10 mg/kg, about 5 mg/kg to about 200 mg/kg, about 50 mg/kg to about 150 mg/mg, about 100 mg/kg to about 500 mg/kg, about 100 mg/kg to about 400 mg/kg, and about 200 mg/kg to about 400 mg/kg), depending on the factors mentioned above. Typically, the clinician will administer a compound until a dosage is reached that results in improvement in or, optimally, elimination of, one or more symptoms of the treated disease or condition. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional assays. One or more agent provided herein may be administered together or at different times (e.g., one agent is administered prior to the administration of a second agent). One or more agent may be administered to a subject using different techniques (e.g., one agent may be administered orally, while a second agent is administered via intramuscular injection or intranasally). One or more agent may be administered such that the one or more agent has a pharmacologic effect in a subject at the same time. Alternatively, one or more agent may be administered, such that the pharmacological activity of the first administered agent is expired prior the administration of one or more secondarily administered agents (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4 secondarily administered agents).

Therefore, those skilled in the art should realize that various changes and modifications may be made to the embodiments described herein without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Similarly, for clarity and conciseness, descriptions of well-known functions and structures are omitted in the following descriptions.', '[0026]    In the related technology, a large number of new features are generated by using a feature engineering, and all the generated synthetic features are put into a classifier for evaluation, so a large amount of time is wasted for evaluating synthetic features classified in a poor category.', '[0027]    Therefore, a method and an apparatus for processing synthetic feature, a method and an apparatus for training a meta feature evaluation model, an electronic device and a storage medium are provided in the present disclosure. Before the classifier evaluates the synthetic features, the synthetic features are screened, and a part of the synthetic features classified in the poor category are directly screened out.

Specifically, a method and an apparatus for processing synthetic features, a method and an apparatus for training a meta feature evaluation model, an electronic device, and a storage medium are described below with reference to the accompanying drawings in the embodiments of the present disclosure.', '[0028]    It should be noted that features in the present disclosure are not limited to numerical features, and may also be non-numerical features. For non-numerical features, the non-numerical features may be transformed into numerical features by means of an equivalent mapping, and then may be processed, which is not limited herein.', '[0029]    FIG. 1  is a schematic flowchart illustrating a method for processing synthetic features in an embodiment of the present disclosure. It should be noted that, the method for processing synthetic features in the embodiment of the present disclosure may be applied to an apparatus for processing synthetic features, and the apparatus for processing synthetic features may be configured in an electronic device.', '[0030]    As illustrated in  FIG. 1 , the method for processing synthetic features may include the following blocks.', '[0031]    At block 101, the synthetic features to be evaluated and original features corresponding to the synthetic features are obtained.', '[0032]    In the embodiment of the present disclosure, the synthetic features to be evaluated may be the synthetic features generated in the feature engineering.', '[0033]    It should be noted that data and features determine the upper limit of machine learning, but model and algorithm are only approximating the upper limit. Therefore, the feature engineering holds a quite important position in machine learning. In practical application, the feature engineering is a key to a success of the machine learning.', '[0034]    It can be understood that the feature engineering is a process that utilizes relevant knowledge in the data field to create features that may enable the machine learning algorithm to achieve an optimal performance. The feature engineering also includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, feature construction and etc. A feature construction method is mainly discussed in the method of the present disclosure. The feature construction is also called feature synthesis, in which a numerical symbol operation is performed on existing features to obtain new features. For example, one numerical value type feature vector is subjected to unary operations such as modules, log, root square and the like. And two numerical value type feature vectors are subjected to binary operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and the like.', '[0035]    At block 102, a feature extraction is performed on the synthetic features to be evaluated based on a number S of pre-trained samples, to obtain meta features with S samples. S is a positive integer.', '[0036]    Optionally, the feature extraction is performed on the synthetic features to be evaluated by adopting a minhash algorithm based on the number S of the pre-trained samples, to obtain the meta features with S samples across different data sets. The meta features may describe the feature similarity of different data sets.', '[0037]    It should be noted that the minimum hash algorithm is one of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithms. The locality-sensitive hashing is a fast nearest neighbor search algorithm suitable for large scale high-dimensional data, which is essentially based on an assumption, the probability that two data with a very high similarity are mapped into a same hash value is large, and the two data with a very low similarity are difficult to be mapped into a same hash value. According to the principle, it is assumed that there are set A and set B, and after elements in set A and set B are hashed by a hash function, if the elements with the minimum hash value in set A and set B are in both AUB and A∩B, then hmin(A) = hmin(B). The similarity of set A and set B may be expressed as the probability that the smallest hash values of set A and set B are equal, that is:  J A , B = Pr hmin A = hmin B .\\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"c0136ee6-6f12-473b-99ce-01155bfc4440-ib0001\" />', '[0038]    At block 103, the meta features are input into a pre-trained meta feature evaluation model for a binary classification prediction, to obtain a probability of binary classification.', '[0039]    It should be noted that the number S of the pre-trained samples in block 102 and a meta feature evaluation model in block 103 are obtained by pre-training. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the synthetic features corresponding to each data set may be obtained based on the original features in the data set. And the feature extraction is performed on the synthetic features by adopting a minimum hash algorithm to obtain a meta feature set. The original features and the synthetic features are trained and tested to obtain the classification label of each of the meta features. A second classifier is trained according to the meta feature set and the classification labels of the meta features in the meta feature set to obtain model parameters and a numerical value of s. The numerical value of s is determined as the number S of the pre-trained samples. The meta feature evaluation model is generated according to the model parameters.', '[0040]    It should also be noted that the second classifier may be random forest or similar bagging (bagging method), boosting (boosting method), etc., which is not limited herein.', '[0041]    At block 104, quality screening is performed on the synthetic features to be evaluated according to the probability of the binary classification, to obtain second synthetic features to be evaluated. The second synthetic features are classified in a good category.', '[0042]    That is, the meta features are input into the pre-trained meta feature evaluation model, to obtain the probability of the binary classification. The quality screening is performed on the synthetic features to be evaluated according to the probability of the binary classification, to obtain the second synthetic features to be evaluated, i.e., the synthetic features classified in a good category.', '[0043]    At block 105, the second synthetic features and the original features are input into a first classifier for evaluation. The evaluation includes training, verifying and testing evaluation.', '[0044]    It should be noted that the first classifier may be random forest or similar bagging (bagging method), boosting (boosting method), etc., which is not limited herein.', '[0045]    That is, the synthetic features classified in the good category and the original features may be input into the first classifier, so that the first classifier performs an evaluation on the synthetic features classified in a good category and the original features, and the purpose of quickly evaluating the quality of the synthetic features may be achieved.', '[0046]    According to the method for processing synthetic features in an embodiment of the present disclosure, the feature extraction is performed on the synthetic features to be evaluated based on the number S of the pre-trained samples, to obtain the meta features with S samples. The meta features are input into the pre-trained meta feature evaluation model for the binary classification prediction, to obtain the probability of the binary classification. The synthetic features to be evaluated are screened according to the probability of the binary classification, to obtain the second synthetic features classified in the good category. The second synthetic features classified in the good category and the original features are input into the first classifier for evaluation, so that the first classifier may quickly evaluate the synthetic features, the time for evaluating the synthetic features classified in a poor category is reduced, and an accuracy ratio of the first classifier may be improved.', '[0047]    It should be noted that in the process of obtaining the meta feature evaluation model and the number S of the samples by pre-training, the classification label corresponding to each meta feature may be obtained by comparing the original feature accuracy ratio with the synthetic feature accuracy ratio, and then the model is trained according to the meta features and their classification labels. As an example, as illustrated in  FIG. 2 , in a method for processing synthetic features in an embodiment of the present disclosure, an implementation process of obtaining a meta feature evaluation model and a number S of samples by pre-training may include the following blocks.', '[0048]    At block 201, k synthetic features of each of n data sets are obtained. n and k are both positive integers.', '[0049]    As an example, n data sets [s<i>, m<i>], i ∈ [1, n] for training are provided, and each data set includes m<i> original features and s<i> samples. i is a serial number of the data set.

For example, at least some devices may be selected from the plurality of devices as participants in the round of training (hereinafter referred to as edge devices), and the current global model may be sent to the selected edge devices. Each edge device may perform a plurality of training iterations on the current global model based on local data, so as to obtain a trained parameter. As an example, after receiving the current global model, an edge device may select training data for the training from the local data, and input the training data into the received current global model to perform the training. The edge device may determine whether to end the training according to whether the trained current global model converges or according to whether the training times reach a specified number of iterations.

The globally shared data is generally independent and identically distributed with total device data existing in the network. In an example, the current aggregation model may be trained using the globally shared dataset, so as to adjust the current aggregation model.', '[0038]    The federated learning method according to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure is described above. This method may be implemented to accelerate a convergence of the current aggregation model by adjusting the current aggregation model using independent and identically distributed globally shared data.

FIG. 3A  shows a schematic diagram of sub-operations of adjusting the current aggregation model based on the globally shared dataset in the federated learning method according to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure.', '[0040]    As shown in  FIG. 3A , a target object detection model is taken as an example of the global model in describing an example operation of adjusting the current aggregation model based on a globally shared dataset 30a. Typically, a model may be represented by a model parameter.', '[0041]    Those skilled in the art should understand that the global model according to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure is not limited to the above-mentioned target object detection model, and may be any other type of model.', '[0042]    The target object detection model used in this example may structurally include two parts, namely, a feature extraction layer 321 and a prediction part 322. The feature extraction layer 321 may acquire the data 30a, such as data containing an image, and perform a feature extraction on the acquired data to generate a plurality of feature maps PI, P2 and P3. The prediction part 322 may detect a target object by using at least one selected from the feature maps PI, P2 and P3, so as to obtain an information of the target object, that is, a prediction result 30b.', '[0043]    In examples of the present disclosure, during a t<th> round of training of the global model, when trained parameters w1, w2, w3... are received from respective edge devices, an aggregation may be performed on the received parameters, for example, the received parameters may be averaged to obtain an aggregation parameter w<t->, and a parameter of the current global model may be updated according to the aggregation parameter w<t->, as indicated by reference numeral 310.', '[0044]    When the update of the parameter of the current global model is completed, a current aggregation model may be obtained, which may be represented by the aggregation parameter w<t->. A training iteration may be performed on the current aggregation model by using the globally shared dataset, so as to adjust the model parameter, as indicated by reference numeral 320. For example, a plurality of training iterations may be performed on the current aggregation model by using the data 30a in the globally shared dataset, and whether to stop the iteration may be determined by determining whether an iteration stop condition is met. The iteration stop condition may include that a loss converges and/or the iteration reaches a specified number of times (hereinafter referred to as a number of server-side iterations), as indicated by reference numerals 323 and 326. In exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the convergence of the current aggregation model may be accelerated by adjusting the current aggregation model using the globally shared data.', '[0045]    FIG. 3B  shows a flowchart of operations in each training iteration of adjusting the parameter by using the globally shared dataset according to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure.', '[0046]    During each training iteration, the globally shared data 30a in the globally shared dataset is input into the current aggregation model as training data. In step S321, a feature extraction is performed on the globally shared data by the feature extraction layer, and in step S322, a prediction is performed on an extracted feature map by the prediction part, so as to obtain the prediction result 30b for the globally shared data 30a.', '[0047]    When the prediction result 30b is obtained, in step S323, a loss is calculated according to the prediction result 30b and the corresponding globally shared data 30a. In step S324, it is determined whether to stop the iteration. For example, whether to stop the iteration may be determined by determining whether an iteration stop condition is met. The iteration stop condition may be that the loss of the model converges and/or the iteration reaches a specified number of times (hereinafter referred to as a number of server-side iterations), as indicated by reference numerals 323 and 326.', '[0048]    When it is determined that the iteration stop condition is not met (S324-No), the model parameter may be adjusted according to the calculated loss, as shown in step S325. Otherwise (S324-Yes), the iteration ends. When the specified number of iterations is reached or the loss converges, the adjusted aggregation model may be used as a new current global model for a (t+1)<th> round of training. The new current global model is represented by a new model parameter w.', '[0049]    In exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the globally shared dataset D0 contains n0 data pairs {x0,j, y0,j}, where x0,j represents j<th> data, and y0,j represents a prediction result for x0,j.', '[0050]    A goal of model training is generally to find the model parameter w that may minimize the loss function on the dataset. A loss function F0(w) may be expressed by Equation (1).  F 0 w ≜ 1 n 0 ∑ x 0 , j y 0 , j ∈ D 0 f w x 0 , j y 0 , j\\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8080a658-6e63-432b-850b-69dcb3ca93f7-ib0001\" />\\nwhere f(w, x0,j, y0,j) is used to measure an error of the model parameter w to the data {x0,j, y0,j}.', '[0051]    However, for the federated learning method according to the present disclosure, if a degree of adjustment using the globally shared data is too large, the adjusted model may excessively shift to the globally shared data, and lose a personality obtained by previous training of the edge devices, and therefore may not bring a performance improvement to the edge devices with rich personalized data. On the other hand, if the degree of adjustment using the globally shared data is too small, it means that the globally shared data is not fully utilized and may not bring a speed improvement to the entire federated learning process.', '[0052]    In view of this, the present disclosure proposes to control the degree of adjustment using the globally shared data, so as to make full use of the globally shared data to accelerate the model convergence while ensuring that the adjustment on the server side may not greatly shift to the globally shared data.', '[0053]    In an example, the present disclosure proposes to introduce a penalty term into the loss function to control the degree of adjustment.', '[0054]    When a current round of training is a t<th> round, the loss function with the penalty term introduced may be expressed by Equation (2).  F 0 w ≜ 1 n 0 ∑ x 0 , j y 0 , j ∈ D 0 f w x 0 , j y 0 , j + μ 2 ‖ w − w t − ‖ 2\\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8080a658-6e63-432b-850b-69dcb3ca93f7-ib0002\" />\\nwhere F0(w) is a loss function of the adjusted aggregation model on the globally shared dataset D0, f(w, x0,j, y0,j) is a loss function of the adjusted aggregation model for the data {x0,j, y0,j}, and µ represents a regularized weight parameter.', '[0055]    In the above example, a second term in Equation (2) uses a 2-norm as the penalty term to constrain the adjusted aggregation model. The penalty term limits a degree of parameter adjustment in a process of adjusting the model parameter using the globally shared data, so that the new current global model represented by the new model parameter w is close to the current aggregation model represented by the aggregation parameter w<t->. In this way, a possibility of over training may be reduced, and the model may converge more smoothly.', '[0056]    In another example, the present disclosure further proposes to dynamically control the number of server-side iterations and/or the number of device-side iterations, so as to control the degree of adjustment.', '[0057]    For example, the number of server-side iterations of training the current aggregation model using the globally shared dataset may be dynamically controlled, so that the number of server-side iterations decreases with an increase of training round.', '[0058]    In the t<th> round in the federated learning process, the server may select a plurality of edge devices by using a device scheduling algorithm, so as to form a set of devices \\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8080a658-6e63-432b-850b-69dcb3ca93f7-ib0003\" />\\n. The selected edge devices may train the current global model sent by the server by using respective local data, so as to obtain trained parameters.

In response to obtaining the current aggregation model, the server may iteratively adjust the current aggregation model multiple times based on the globally shared dataset. The number of server-side iterations server_itert may be expressed by Equation (3).  server _ iter t = α t ∗ local _ iter t\\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8080a658-6e63-432b-850b-69dcb3ca93f7-ib0005\" />\\nwhere local_itert represents an average number of iterations of the edge devices in the set of devices \\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8080a658-6e63-432b-850b-69dcb3ca93f7-ib0006\" />\\n(hereinafter referred to as a number of device-side iterations), and αt represents an iteration coefficient.

Typically, decay has a value between 0 and 1, and a smaller value means a faster decay. Since the value of decay is less than 1 and αt is proportional to decay<t>, αt may decrease rapidly with the increase of the round t.', '[0062]    In this way, through a combined action of the number of device-side iterations and the iteration coefficient, it is possible to perform more iterations using the globally shared dataset in the early stage of federated learning to accelerate the model convergence, and reduce the number of iterations performed using the globally shared dataset in the middle and later stages of federated learning, so that more data from the edge devices may be used, and the trained model may be highly adaptable to users.', '[0063]    The above describes that the number of server-side iterations is dynamically controlled, so that the number of server-side iterations decreases with the increase of training round, thereby ensuring that the model may be highly adaptable to users while accelerating the model convergence.', '[0064]    It should be noted that in addition to dynamically controlling the number of server-side iterations, it is also possible to dynamically control the number of device-side iterations that each edge device performs in each round of training, so that the number of device-side iterations increases with the increase of training round, thereby achieving the same effect as above.

When operating in an autonomous mode, the vehicle can navigate to various locations using onboard sensors, allowing the vehicle to travel with minimal human interaction or in some cases without any passengers.', '[0003]    Motion planning, also referred to as path planning, is key in large-scale, safety-critical, real-world autonomous driving vehicles. A motion planner can be ruled-based or learning-based. Each type of motion planners has its pros and cons. For example, a ruled-based motion planner formulates motion planning as constrained optimization problems. Although the ruled-based motion planner is reliable and interpretable, its performance heavily depends on how well the optimization problems are formulated with parameters. These parameters are designed for various purposes, such as modeling different scenarios, balancing the weights of each individual objective, and thus require manual fine-tuning for optimal performance. On the other hand, a learning-based planner learns from the massive amount of human demonstrations to create human-like driving plans, thus avoiding the tedious design process of rules and constraints. However, the lack of interpretability hinders its application on safety-critical tasks such as autonomous driving.', 'SUMMARY', '[0004]    In a first aspect, there is provided a computer-implemented method of training a learning-based critic for tuning a motion planner of an autonomous driving vehicle (ADV), the method including:\\nreceiving, by an automatic driving simulation platform, training data that incudes human driving trajectories and random trajectories derived from the human driving trajectories;\\ntraining, by the automatic driving simulation platform, a learning-based critic using the training data;\\nidentifying, by the learning-based critic running at the automatic driving simulation platform, a set of discrepant trajectories by comparing a first set of trajectories, and a second set of trajectories, wherein the first set trajectories are generated by a motion planner with a first set of parameters, and the second set of trajectories are generated by the motion planner with a second of parameters; and\\nrefining, by the neural network training platform, the learning-based critic based on the set of discrepant trajectories.', '[0005]    In a second aspect, there is provided a non-transitory machine-readable medium having instructions stored therein, which when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform operations of the method described in the first aspect.', '[0006]    In a third aspect, there is provided an automatic driving simulation platform, which is configured to perform the method described in the first aspect.', '[0007]    With the preset disclosure, the automatic tuning framework can remove human efforts in tedious parameter tuning, reduce tuning time, while retaining the physical and safety constraints of the ruled-based motion planner.

The appearances of the phrase \"in one embodiment\" in various places in the specification do not necessarily all refer to the same embodiment.', '[0011]    As described above, ruled-based motion planners have many advantages, but requires manual tuning, which typically is inefficient, and highly depends on empirical knowledge. A motion planner in this disclosure can be a speed planner or a planning module of an ADV. In this disclosure, some of the embodiments are illustrated using trajectories, and some of the embodiments are illustrated using speed plans. Embodiments illustrated using trajectories can be similarly illustrated using speed plans, or vice versa.', '[0012]    According to various embodiments, described herein is an automatic tuning framework for tuning a motion planner of an ADV, and methods of training a learning-based critic, which is a key component of the automatic tuning framework.', '[0013]    In an embodiment, a method of training a learning-based critic includes receiving, at an automatic driving simulation platform, training data that incudes human driving trajectories and random trajectories derived from the human driving trajectories; training by the automatic driving simulation platform a learning-based critic using the training data. The method further includes identifying, by the learning-based critic running at the automatic driving simulation platform, a set of discrepant trajectories by comparing a first set of trajectories, and a second set of trajectories. The first set trajectories are generated by a motion planner with a first set of parameters, and the second set of trajectories are generated by the motion planner with a second of parameters. The method further incudes refining, by the automatic driving simulation platform the learning-based critic based on the set of discrepant trajectories.', '[0014]    In an embodiment, the automatic driving simulation platform include hardware components and services for training neural networks, simulating an ADV, and tuning the parameters of each module of the ADV. The motion planner is one of the module of the ADV, which is represented by a dynamic model in the automatic driving simulation platform. The motion planner can be a planning module, a speed planning module, or a combined module of the planning module and the spend planning module.', '[0015]    In one embodiment, the first set of parameters of the motion planner are identified by the learning-based critic for one or more driving environments, and the second set of parameters are a set of existing parameters for the motion planner. Each of the random trajectories is derived from one of the human driving trajectories. The deriving of the random trajectory from the corresponding human driving trajectory comprises determining a starting point and an ending point of corresponding human driving trajectory, varying one of one or more parameters of the corresponding human driving trajectory, and replacing a corresponding parameter of the human driving trajectory with the varied parameter to get the random trajectory. The parameter can be varied by giving the parameter a different value selected from a predetermined range.', '[0016]    In one embodiment, the learning-based critic includes an encoder and a similarity network, and each of the encoder and the similarity network is a neural network model. Each of the encoder and the similarity network is one of a recurrent neural network (RNN) or multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network. In one embodiment, the encoder is a RNN network, with each RNN cell being a gated recurrent unit (GRU).', '[0017]    In one embodiment, features extracted the training data include speed features, path features, and obstacle features, and each feature is associated with a goal feature, and the goal feature is a map scenario related feature. These extracted features can be used for training the learning-based critic.', '[0018]    In one embodiment, the trained encoder can be trained using the human driving trajectories, encodes speed features, path features, obstacle features, and associated goal features, and generates an embedding with trajectories that are different from the human driving trajectories. The similarity network is trained using the human driving trajectories and the random trajectories, and is to generate a score reflecting a difference between a trajectory generated by the motion planner and a corresponding trajectory from the embedding.', '[0019]    In one embodiment, the loss function used to train the learning-based critic can include an element for measuring similarity between trajectories, which speeds up the training process of the learning-based critic.', '[0020]    In another embodiment, described herein is a method of tuning a motion planner of an autonomous driving vehicle (ADV). The method includes building an objective function from a learning-based critic; and applying an optimization operation to optimize the objective function to determine a set of optimal parameters for a motion planner of a dynamic model of an autonomous driving vehicle (ADV) for one or more driving environments. The method further includes generating a first set of trajectories using the motion planner with the set of optimal parameters for the one or more driving environments; generating a second set of trajectories using the learning-based critic with a set of existing parameters for the one or more driving environment; and generating a score indicating a difference between the first set of trajectories and the second set of trajectories.', '[0021]    In one embodiment, the method further includes identifying a set of discrepant trajectories by comparing a first set of trajectories and a second set of trajectories; and refining the learning-based critic based on the set of discrepant trajectories.', '[0022]    In one embodiment, the above operations can be repeated in a closed loop until the score reaches a predetermined threshold.', '[0023]    The automatic tuning framework can be deployed to an automatic driving simulation platform, and can include a learning-based critic that serves as a customizable motion planner metric. The learning-base critic can extract a latent space embedding of human driving trajectories based on the driving environment, and can measure the similarity between a motion-planner generated trajectories and a pseudo human driving plan. Thus, using the learning-based critic, the automatic tuning framework can automatically guide a ruled-based motion planner to generate human-like driving trajectories by choosing a set of optimal parameters.', '[0024]    In one embodiment, in the automatic driving simulation platform, the motion planner can be a planning module or a speed module of a dynamic model of an ADV. The motion planner is parameterized and thus highly configurable. The automatic tuning framework can use the Bayesian parameter searching method or a sequential model-based algorithm configuration to speed up the parameter tuning process.', '[0025]    In one embodiment, the learning-based critic acts as the objective function that describes the costs of various parameters of a motion planner. Thus, by optimizing the learning-based critic, the automatic tuning framework can identify a set of optimal parameters to optimize the parameters of the motion planner.', '[0026]    In one embodiment, the learning-based critic is trained using an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) method, and can quantitatively measure trajectories based on human driving data. With this learning-based critic, the automatic tuning framework, which also includes simulation-based evaluation, can enable a ruled-based motion planner to achieve human-like motion planning.', '[0027]    Compared to existing tuning frameworks, the automatic tuning framework can remove human efforts in tedious parameter tuning, reduce tuning time, and make the deployment of the motion planner more scalable. Further, the physical and safety constraints in the rule-based motion planner are retained, which maintains reliability. In addition, when trained with different human driving datasets, the learning-based critic can extract different driving styles, which can be further reflected in motion planners tuned by the automatic tuning framework to create different personalized motion planners.', '[0028]    The embodiments described above are not exhaustive of all aspects of the present invention. It is contemplated that the invention includes all embodiments that can be practiced from all suitable combinations of the various embodiments summarized above, and also those disclosed below.', 'Motion Planner Tuning Framework', '[0029]    Figure 1 illustrates a motion planner tuning framework 100 according to one embodiment. The motion planner framework includes a data phase 103, a training phase 105, a tuning phrase 107, and an evaluation phase 109, each phase including a number of software and/or hardware components that complete a set of operations for performing a number of functions.', '[0030]    In the data phase 103, expert trajectories 111 are collected, from which random trajectories 115 are generated using an acceleration-time sampler (AT-sampler) 113. The expert trajectories 111 are human driving trajectories generated by one or more ADVs that are manually driven by human beings, e.g., hired professional drivers.', '[0031]    The expert trajectories 111, also referred as demonstration trajectories, can be contained in a record file recorded by the ADV while it is being manually driven. Each expert trajectory can include points that the ADV is expected to pass, and several driving parameters of the ADV, such as heading, speed, jerks, and acceleration of the ADV at each point.', '[0032]    In one embody, the AT-sampler 113 can be a software component used to generate additional trajectories to increase the size of the training dataset. Since the expert trajectories 111 are collected by vehicles that are manually driven by human beings, they are limited by available resources, e.g., the number of professional drivers that can be hired. The AT-sampler 113 can generate additional trajectories from the expert trajectories 111.', '[0033]    The random trajectories 115 are the additional trajectories generated by the AT-sampler 113. From each expert trajectory, i.e., human driving trajectory, the AT-sampler 113 can generate many other trajectories (e.g., 1000 trajectories), each generated trajectory having the same starting point and destination point as the original expert trajectory, but having one or more different points in the middle, and/or having variations in one or more of the driving parameters of the ADV on each point on the expert/demonstration trajectory.', '[0034]    As an illustrative example, an expert trajectory starts with point A, ends with Z, and passes points B, C, E, F, and G, with accelerations of 0.1m/s<2>, 0.5m/s<2>, 0.9 m/s<2>, 0.2 m/s<2>, and 0.7m/s<2> at each point respectively. From this expert trajectory, the AT-sampler 113 can use different accelerations at one or more of the points B, C, E, E, F, and G to generate different trajectories. The different accelerations can be selected from the range between 0.1m/s<2> and 0.9 m/s<2>. The AT-sampler 113 can sample different accelerations from the range and use them to generate different trajectories.', '[0035]    In one embodiment, to avoid generating unrealistic samples and to reduce the sample space, the AT-sampler 113 can infer speed and jerk parameters from the acceleration parameters.', '[0036]    In the training phase 105, a feature extractor 117 can extract features from the demonstration trajectories 111 and the generated trajectories 115. The feature extractor 117 can be part of an automatic driving simulation platform that will be described in details in Figure 6. The extracted features can be used to train a learning-based critic 119. Examples of the extracted features can include speed, acceleration, jerk, and heading of an ADV each point on a trajectory.', '[0037]    In one embodiment, the demonstration trajectories 111 and the generated trajectories 115 are associated, and this corresponding relationship can be considered during the training of the learning-based critic 119. For example, only when a generated trajectory has a single association with one demonstration trajectory can the loss of that generated trajectory be computed. In one embodiment, the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is used to train the learning-based critic. The IRL is a training algorithm for learning the objectives, values, or rewards of an agent (i.e. the learning-based critic 119) by observing its behavior.', '[0038]    In the tuning phase 107, a Bayesian optimization operation 121 is performed by the automatic driving simulation platform to tune a motion planner of an ADV by optimizing an objective function built from the learning-based critic 119.', '[0039]    For example, if θ denotes a parameterized deterministic policy, which is a mapping from a set of environment configurations sequence C to an ego vehicle\\'s configuration sequence Ĉ. Thus, θ can denote a motion planner or a speed planner. The mapping is fixed when parameters of the motion planner or the speed planner are fixed. Further, let\\'s assume that fcritic denotes a cost that a learning-based critic generates to measure the quality of speed plans or trajectories generated by a speed planner or the motion planner with respect to the configurations C. Then, an objective function can be built from the learning-based critic:  Φ * = arg min Φ F critic θ Φ sp C\\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"a7d190f6-c6a6-48a0-8102-c55c302c1952-ib0001\" />', '[0040]    In the above objective function,  θ Φ sp\\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"a7d190f6-c6a6-48a0-8102-c55c302c1952-ib0002\" />\\ndenotes a speed planner, C is a set of predicted environment configurations generated in various scenarios, and Fcritic is a composition of costs, each being a fcritic for a different speed plan of a range of speed plans generated by a speed planner. Multiple speed plans are used in order to accurately reflect the performance of the speed planner, because a single speed plan may fail to reflect the motion planner\\'s performance in different scenarios. The automatic driving simulation platform can use the Bayesian optimization operation 121 to identify a set of parameters for the speed planner that would minimize the total cost Fcritic. That set of parameters would be the optimal parameters for the speed planner. Thus, the automatic driving simulation platform tunes the speed planner by identifying a set of parameters that would minimize the total cost of a range of speed plans generated by the speed planner.', '[0041]    In one embodiment, the tuning process of the speed planner can start by generating a first set of speed plans using the speed planner with a first set of parameters. Each generated speed plans can be provided as input to the learning-based critic, which can generate a score indicating how close the generated speed plan is to a human driving speed plan. The closer, the lower the score. A total score for the first set of speed plans can be calculated to get a first total score.', '[0042]    Then, a second set of parameters is selected for the speed planner, which generates a second set of speed plans. For the second set of speed plans, the learning-based critic can be generated a second total score. The process can continue until a total score that meets a predetermined threshold is find or a predetermined number of iterations is reached.', '[0043]    The above description uses the tuning of the speed planner as an example to illustrate how the parameters of the speed planner is tuned. The motion planner can be similarly tuned as described above.', '[0044]    In the tuning phase 107, some discrepant trajectories 125 can be identified. The discrepant trajectories 125 are corner cases in which the motion planner performs as expected but the learning-based critic 119 reports high costs, or vice versa. These corner cases exist because it is difficult to collect data for some rare scenarios. Thus, the learning-based critic 119 may have been trained without using data for the rare scenario. When such a rare scenario is encountered during the tuning phase, the learning-based critic 119 is unlikely to report an accurate cost. These corner cases can be high-cost good behavior cases or low-cost bad behavior cases. The automatic driving simulation platform, while tuning the parameters of the motion planner, can collect the corner cases, and add them to the training data set for refining the learning-based critic 119.', '[0045]    In the evaluation phase 109, the tuned motion planner can be deployed to an autonomous driving simulation platform. Default trajectories 127 and tuned trajectories 131 can be compared in terms of the evaluation metrics 129, which can be the same set of evaluation metrics as the evaluation metrics 123. The default trajectories 127 are generated by the motion planner before it is tuned. The autonomous driving simulation platform can use the same record file to recreate virtual environments for generating both the default trajectories 127 and the tuned trajectories 131. Results of the comparison between the default trajectories 127 and the tuned trajectories 131 can be used to refine the learning-based critic 119 and the evaluation metrics 123 and 129.', '[0046]    Figures 2A, 2B, and 2C illustrate how additional trajectories are generated from demonstration trajectories according to one embodiment. Figure 2B shows an example acceleration-time space, which includes a range of accelerations against time. An AT-sampler such as the one 113 described in Figure 1 can sample the acceleration-time space and use the sampled accelerations to generate jerk features as shown in Figure 2A, and speed features as shown in Figure 2C. Various combinations of accelerations, jerks and speeds can be used to generate additional trajectories corresponding to each demonstration trajectory.', '[0047]    Figure 3 illustrates input features for the learning-based critic according to one embodiment. As shown in Figure 3, the input features for the learning-based critic include speed-related features 301, path-related features 303, and obstacle-related features 305. The speed features 301 can include speed, acceleration, and jerk. The path-related features 303 can include speed limit, heading angle, and curvature. The obstacle-related features can include features in six relative directions to the ego car; the fix directions are left-front, front, right-front, left-rear, rear, and right-rear. Examples of the obstacle-related features can include obstacle type, relative position, speed, acceleration in Frenet Frames and Euclidean distance to the ego vehicle. Each of the above features can be associated with one of a map scenario related metrics for a trajectory.', '[0048]    In one embodiment, all the above features can be extracted from record files recorded by various ADVs manually driven by human drivers, e.g., hired professional drivers.', '[0049]    Figures 4A, 4B and 4C illustrate a loss function for training the learning-based critic according to one embodiment.', '[0050]    In one embodiment, the learning-based critic can be trained using the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) with human driving data and tweaked human driving data. An AT-sampler can tweak the human driving data to derive additional data to increase the size of the training dataset.', '[0051]    The purpose of the IRL is to minimize or maximize a parameterized objective function. When the objective function is to be minimized, it can be parameterized as a cost function, loss function, or error function. When the objective function is to be maximized, it can be parameterized as a reward function.', '[0052]    Figure 4A illustrates a loss function for training the parameterized learning-based critic according to one embodiment. As shown in Figure 4A, the loss function  L critic\\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"a7d190f6-c6a6-48a0-8102-c55c302c1952-ib0003\" />\\nis to be minimized such that the parameterized critic fcritic, ϕ can be optimized and thus considered as being trained. A parameterized critic is a critic that is represented in terms of parameters.', '[0053]    In the loss function  L critic\\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"a7d190f6-c6a6-48a0-8102-c55c302c1952-ib0004\" />\\n, τ is a trajectory in the training dataset D, and τ<∗> is a trajectory in the demonstration trajectories D<∗>. As shown, the loss function  L critic\\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"a7d190f6-c6a6-48a0-8102-c55c302c1952-ib0005\" />\\nincludes two parts 4a and 4b. Part 4a represents the cost of human driving trajectories, and thus minimizing part 4a would decrease the cost of the human driving trajectories. To avoid fcritic, ϕ (τ<∗>) decreasing too much, fcritic, ϕ (τ<∗>) is limited to values that are greater than 0. Minimizing part 4b means regression fcritic, ϕ (τ) with sim(τ, τ<∗>). The term sim(τ, τ<∗>) signifies similarity of a trajectory to a human driving trajectory. Thus, the loss function  L critic\\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"a7d190f6-c6a6-48a0-8102-c55c302c1952-ib0006\" />\\nboth minimizes the cost of the human driving trajectories and regresses on the similarity of a trajectory to a corresponding human driving trajectory.', '[0054]    The benefits of using the above loss function to train the learning-based critic are shown by Figures 4B and 4C, where the y-axis represents reward, and the x-axis sim(τ, τ<∗>) signifies the similarity of a trajectory to one optimal trajectory τ<∗>.', '[0055]    Figure 4B shows the training using the traditional max-entropy IRL that does not consider the trajectory similarity, and Figure 4C shows the training using regression on the trajectory similarity property.', '[0056]    In one embodiment, the similarity between two trajectories can be defined with L1 distance between the normalized speed features of the two trajectories. The L1 distance is also called Manhattan distance, and is a sum of absolute distances between measures in all dimensions (e.g., speed, acceleration, jerk).', '[0057]    As shown in Figure 4B and 4C, when sim(τ, τ<∗>) is 0, meaning when there are no difference between a trajectory and a human driving trajectory, the reward R is maximized in both Figure 4B and 4C.', '[0058]    However, in Figure 4B, the entropy of all the possible trajectories is to be maximized without considering similarity between any trajectories. Thus, the reward function in Figure 4B has many local optimals, which make optimization more difficult, compared to Figure 4C, where the reward function does not have any local optimal.', '[0059]    When a trajectory is more similar to the human driving trajectory, a higher reward can be expected. In Figure 4C, a quantitative measure is given for the similarity of a trajectory to a human driving trajectory, which further benefits the optimization.', '[0060]    Figures 5A and 5B illustrate an architectural design of the learning-based critic according to an embodiment. Figure 5A shows a training process of an encoder 501. The encoder 501 and a decoder 506 are trained together using human driving trajectories.', '[0061]    During the training process of the encoder 501, the encoder 501 encodes the environment features ε/s(ĉ) and goal feature feag into an embedding 515. The environment features include all the input features (except speed features) described above for the training of the learning-based critic as described in Figure 3. When the input features are encoded into the embedding 515, they have less dimensions. Such dimension compression can speed up the training and inference of the learning-based critic. Then, the decoder 506 can recover speed features from the embedding layer 515 based on the environment features as part of the process of training the encoder 501.', '[0062]    The embedding 515 is a neural network layer with a relatively low-dimension space, which can make machine learning easier on large inputs like sparse vectors.', '[0063]    In one embodiment, the encoder-decoder model used to train the encoder 501 above is a gated recurrent unit (GRU)-Encoder-Decoder (GRU-ED) model. Both the encoder 501 and the decoder 506 can be a recurrent neural network.', '[0064]    In Figure 5A, each of the RNN cells 503, 505, and 507 is a GRU that has two inputs, a hidden state and an input state. Trajectories 506, 508 and 510 are fed into the encoder 501 in sequence. In addition, goal features feag 504 are passed to a linear layer 502, and mapped to an initial hidden state of the linear layer 502. As shown, the input sequence of the encoder 501 is in a reversed order, which makes the embedding 515 focus on features in the nearest time slot.', '[0065]    Figure 5B shows an example of the learning-based critic, which includes the encoder 501, the embedding layer 517, and a similarity network 527. During inference, the pre-trained encoder 501 can generate the demonstration embedding 515, from which trajectories and/speed plans can be recovered given a particular environment. These trajectories and/or speed features may not raw trajectories and/or speed plans recorded by a record files. Rather, they are trajectories and/or speed plans inferred by the learning-based critic based on its training.', '[0066]    The inferred trajectories and/or speed plans can be fed into the similarity network 527, together with trajectories and/speed plans generated by a motion planner to be evaluated by the learning-based critic.', '[0067]    The similarity network 527 can be a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model or a RNN model, and can be trained using the dataset that includes both human driving trajectories and random trajectories generated by the AT-sampler. The trained similarity network 527 can be used to measure similarity between a demonstration trajectory from the embedding layer 515 and a trajectory 512 generated by a motion planner.', '[0068]    Figure 6 illustrates an example of an autonomous driving simulation platform for some embodiments of the invention. The safety and reliability of an ADV are guaranteed by massive functional and performance tests, which are expensive and time consuming if these tests were conducted using physical vehicles on roads. A simulation platform 601 shown in this figure can be used to perform these tasks less costly and more efficiently.', '[0069]    In one embodiment, the example simulation platform 601 includes a dynamic model 602 of an ADV, a game-engine based simulator 619 and a record file player 621. The game-engine based simulator 619 can provide a 3D virtual world where sensors can perceive and provide precise ground truth data for every piece of an environment. The record file player 621 can replay record files recorded in the real world for use in testing the functions and performance of various modules of the dynamic model 602.', '[0070]    In one embodiment, the ADV dynamic model 602 can be a virtual vehicle that includes a number of core software modules, including a perception module 605, a prediction module 605, a planning module 609, a control module 609, a speed planner module 613, a CAN Bus module 611, a speed planner module 613, and a localization module 615. The functions of these modules are described in detail in Figures 9 and 11.', '[0071]    As further shown, the simulation platform 601 can include a guardian module 623, which is a safety module that performs the function of an action center and intervenes when a monitor 625 detects a failure. When all modules work as expected, the guardian module 623 allows the flow of control to work normally. When a crash in one of the modules is detected by the monitor 625, the guardian module 623 can prevent control signals from reaching the CAN Bus 611 and can bring the ADV dynamic model 602 to a stop.', '[0072]    The simulation platform 601 can include a human machine interface (HMI) 627, which is a module for viewing the status of the dynamic model 602, and controlling the dynamic model 602 in real time.', '[0073]    Figure 7 is a flow chart illustrating a process of training a learning-based critic for tuning a motion planner of an ADV according to one embodiment. The process may be performed by processing logic which may include software, hardware, or a combination thereof. For example, the process may be performed by various components and services in the autonomous simulation platform described in Figure 6.', '[0074]    Referring to Figure 7, in operation 701, the processing logic receives training data that incudes human driving trajectories and random trajectories derived from the human driving trajectories. In operation 703, the processing logic trains a learning-based critic using the training data. In operation 705, the processing logic identifies a set of discrepant trajectories by comparing a first set of trajectories, and a second set of trajectories. The first set trajectories are generated by a motion planner with a first set of parameters, and the second set of trajectories are generated by the motion planner with a second of parameters. In operation 707, the processing logic refines the learning-based critic based on the set of discrepant trajectories.', '[0075]    Figure 8 a flow chart illustrating a process of tuning a motion planner of an autonomous driving vehicle (ADV) according to one embodiment. The process may be performed by processing logic which may include software, hardware, or a combination thereof. For example, the process may be performed by various components and services in the autonomous simulation platform described in Figure 6.', '[0076]    Referring to Figure 8, in operation 801, the processing logic building an objective function from a learning-based critic. In operation 803, the processing logic applies an optimization operation to optimize the objective function to determine a set of optimal parameters for a motion planner of a dynamic model of an autonomous driving vehicle (ADV) for one or more driving environments. In operation 805, the processing logic generates a first set of trajectories using the motion planner with the set of optimal parameters for the one or more driving environments. In operation 807, the processing logic generates a second set of trajectories using the learning-based critic with a set of existing parameters for the one or more driving environment. In operation 809, the processing logic generates a score indicating a difference between the first set of trajectories and the second set of trajectories.', 'Automatic Driving Vehicle', '[0077]    Figure 9 is a block diagram illustrating an autonomous driving vehicle according to one embodiment. Referring to Figure 9, autonomous driving vehicle 901 may be communicatively coupled to one or more servers over a network, which may be any type of networks such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN) such as the Internet, a cellular network, a satellite network, or a combination thereof, wired or wireless. The server(s) may be any kind of servers or a cluster of servers, such as Web or cloud servers, application servers, backend servers, or a combination thereof. A server may be a data analytics server, a content server, a traffic information server, a map and point of interest (MPOI) server, or a location server, etc.', '[0078]    An autonomous driving vehicle refers to a vehicle that can be configured to in an autonomous mode in which the vehicle navigates through an environment with little or no input from a driver. Such an autonomous driving vehicle can include a sensor system having one or more sensors that are configured to detect information about the environment in which the vehicle operates. The vehicle and its associated controller(s) use the detected information to navigate through the environment. Autonomous driving vehicle 901 can operate in a manual mode, a full autonomous mode, or a partial autonomous mode.', '[0079]    In one embodiment, autonomous driving vehicle 901 includes, but is not limited to, autonomous driving system (ADS) 910, vehicle control system 911, wireless communication system 912, user interface system 913, and sensor system 915. Autonomous driving vehicle 901 may further include certain common components included in ordinary vehicles, such as, an engine, wheels, steering wheel, transmission, etc., which may be controlled by vehicle control system 911 and/or ADS 910 using a variety of communication signals and/or commands, such as, for example, acceleration signals or commands, deceleration signals or commands, steering signals or commands, braking signals or commands, etc.', '[0080]    Components 910-915 may be communicatively coupled to each other via an interconnect, a bus, a network, or a combination thereof. For example, components 910-519 may be communicatively coupled to each other via a controller area network (CAN) bus. A CAN bus is a vehicle bus standard designed to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other in applications without a host computer. It is a message-based protocol, designed originally for multiplex electrical wiring within automobiles, but is also used in many other contexts.', '[0081]    Referring now to Figure 10, in one embodiment, sensor system 915 includes, but it is not limited to, one or more cameras 1011, global positioning system (GPS) unit 1012, inertial measurement unit (IMU) 1013, radar unit 1014, and a light detection and range (LIDAR) unit 1015. GPS system 1012 may include a transceiver operable to provide information regarding the position of the autonomous driving vehicle. IMU unit 1013 may sense position and orientation changes of the autonomous driving vehicle based on inertial acceleration. Radar unit 1014 may represent a system that utilizes radio signals to sense objects within the local environment of the autonomous driving vehicle. In some embodiments, in addition to sensing objects, radar unit 1014 may additionally sense the speed and/or heading of the objects. LIDAR unit 1015 may sense objects in the environment in which the autonomous driving vehicle is located using lasers. LIDAR unit 1015 could include one or more laser sources, a laser scanner, and one or more detectors, among other system components. Cameras 1011 may include one or more devices to capture images of the environment surrounding the autonomous driving vehicle. Cameras 1011 may be still cameras and/or video cameras. A camera may be mechanically movable, for example, by mounting the camera on a rotating and/or tilting a platform.', '[0082]    Sensor system 915 may further include other sensors, such as, a sonar sensor, an infrared sensor, a steering sensor, a throttle sensor, a braking sensor, and an audio sensor (e.g., microphone). An audio sensor may be configured to capture sound from the environment surrounding the autonomous driving vehicle. A steering sensor may be configured to sense the steering angle of a steering wheel, wheels of the vehicle, or a combination thereof. A throttle sensor and a braking sensor sense the throttle position and braking position of the vehicle, respectively. In some situations, a throttle sensor and a braking sensor may be integrated as an integrated throttle/braking sensor.', '[0083]    In one embodiment, vehicle control system 911 includes, but is not limited to, steering unit 1001, throttle unit 1002 (also referred to as an acceleration unit), and braking unit 1003. Steering unit 1001 is to adjust the direction or heading of the vehicle. Throttle unit 1002 is to control the speed of the motor or engine that in turn controls the speed and acceleration of the vehicle. Braking unit 1003 is to decelerate the vehicle by providing friction to slow the wheels or tires of the vehicle. Note that the components as shown in Figure 10 may be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof.', '[0084]    Referring back to Figure 9, wireless communication system 912 is to allow communication between autonomous driving vehicle 901 and external systems, such as devices, sensors, other vehicles, etc. For example, wireless communication system 912 can wirelessly communicate with one or more devices directly or via a communication network. Wireless communication system 912 can use any cellular communication network or a wireless local area network (WLAN), e.g., using WiFi to communicate with another component or system. Wireless communication system 912 could communicate directly with a device (e.g., a mobile device of a passenger, a display device, a speaker within vehicle 901), for example, using an infrared link, Bluetooth, etc. User interface system 913 may be part of peripheral devices implemented within vehicle 901 including, for example, a keyboard, a touch screen display device, a microphone, and a speaker, etc.', '[0085]    Some or all of the functions of autonomous driving vehicle 901 may be controlled or managed by ADS 910, especially when operating in an autonomous driving mode. ADS 910 includes the necessary hardware (e.g., processor(s), memory, storage) and software (e.g., operating system, planning and routing programs) to receive information from sensor system 915, control system 911, wireless communication system 912, and/or user interface system 913, process the received information, plan a route or path from a starting point to a destination point, and then drive vehicle 901 based on the planning and control information. Alternatively, ADS 910 may be integrated with vehicle control system 911.', '[0086]    For example, a user as a passenger may specify a starting location and a destination of a trip, for example, via a user interface. ADS 910 obtains the trip related data. For example, ADS 910 may obtain location and route data from an MPOI server. The location server provides location services and the MPOI server provides map services and the POIs of certain locations. Alternatively, such location and MPOI information may be cached locally in a persistent storage device of ADS 910.', '[0087]    While autonomous driving vehicle 901 is moving along the route, ADS 910 may also obtain real-time traffic information from a traffic information system or server (TIS). Note that the servers may be operated by a third party entity. Alternatively, the functionalities of the servers may be integrated with ADS 910. Based on the real-time traffic information, MPOI information, and location information, as well as real-time local environment data detected or sensed by sensor system 915 (e.g., obstacles, objects, nearby vehicles), ADS 910 can plan an optimal route and drive vehicle 901, for example, via control system 911, according to the planned route to reach the specified destination safely and efficiently.', '[0088]    Figure 11 is a block diagram illustrating an example of the autonomous driving system 910 according to one embodiment. The autonomous driving system 910 may be implemented as a part of autonomous driving vehicle 901 of Figure 9 including, but is not limited to, ADS 910, control system 911, and sensor system 915.', '[0089]    Referring to Figure 11, ADS 910 includes, but is not limited to, localization module 1101, perception module 1102, prediction module 1103, decision module 1104, planning module 1105, control module 1106, routing module 1107, speed planner module 1108. These modules and the modules described in Figure 6 perform similar functions.', '[0090]    Some or all of modules 1101-1108 may be implemented in software, hardware, or a combination thereof. For example, these modules may be installed in persistent storage device 1152, loaded into memory 1151, and executed by one or more processors (not shown). Note that some or all of these modules may be communicatively coupled to or integrated with some or all modules of vehicle control system 911 of Figure 9. Some of modules 1101-1108 may be integrated together as an integrated module.', '[0091]    Localization module 1101 determines a current location of autonomous driving vehicle 901 (e.g., leveraging GPS unit 1012) and manages any data related to a trip or route of a user. Localization module 1101 (also referred to as a map and route module) manages any data related to a trip or route of a user. A user may log in and specify a starting location and a destination of a trip, for example, via a user interface. Localization module 1101 communicates with other components of autonomous driving vehicle 901, such as map and route data 1111, to obtain the trip related data. For example, localization module 1101 may obtain location and route data from a location server and a map and POI (MPOI) server. A location server provides location services and an MPOI server provides map services and the POIs of certain locations, which may be cached as part of map and route data 1111. While autonomous driving vehicle 901 is moving along the route, localization module 1101 may also obtain real-time traffic information from a traffic information system or server.', '[0092]    Based on the sensor data provided by sensor system 915 and localization information obtained by localization module 1101, a perception of the surrounding environment is determined by perception module 1102. The perception information may represent what an ordinary driver would perceive surrounding a vehicle in which the driver is driving. The perception can include the lane configuration, traffic light signals, a relative position of another vehicle, a pedestrian, a building, crosswalk, or other traffic related signs (e.g., stop signs, yield signs), etc., for example, in a form of an object. The lane configuration includes information describing a lane or lanes, such as, for example, a shape of the lane (e.g., straight or curvature), a width of the lane, how many lanes in a road, one-way or two-way lane, merging or splitting lanes, exiting lane, etc.', '[0093]    Perception module 1102 may include a computer vision system or functionalities of a computer vision system to process and analyze images captured by one or more cameras in order to identify objects and/or features in the environment of autonomous driving vehicle. The objects can include traffic signals, road way boundaries, other vehicles, pedestrians, and/or obstacles, etc. The computer vision system may use an object recognition algorithm, video tracking, and other computer vision techniques. In some embodiments, the computer vision system can map an environment, track objects, and estimate the speed of objects, etc. Perception module 1102 can also detect objects based on other sensors data provided by other sensors such as a radar and/or LIDAR.', '[0094]    For each of the objects, prediction module 1103 predicts what the object will behave under the circumstances. The prediction is performed based on the perception data perceiving the driving environment at the point in time in view of a set of map/rout information 1111 and traffic rules 1112. For example, if the object is a vehicle at an opposing direction and the current driving environment includes an intersection, prediction module 1103 will predict whether the vehicle will likely move straight forward or make a turn. If the perception data indicates that the intersection has no traffic light, prediction module 1103 may predict that the vehicle may have to fully stop prior to enter the intersection. If the perception data indicates that the vehicle is currently at a left-turn only lane or a right-turn only lane, prediction module 1103 may predict that the vehicle will more likely make a left turn or right turn respectively.', '[0095]    For each of the objects, decision module 1104 makes a decision regarding how to handle the object. For example, for a particular object (e.g., another vehicle in a crossing route) as well as its metadata describing the object (e.g., a speed, direction, turning angle), decision module 1104 decides how to encounter the object (e.g., overtake, yield, stop, pass). Decision module 1104 may make such decisions according to a set of rules such as traffic rules or driving rules 1112, which may be stored in persistent storage device 1152.', '[0096]    Routing module 1107 is configured to provide one or more routes or paths from a starting point to a destination point. For a given trip from a start location to a destination location, for example, received from a user, routing module 1107 obtains route and map information 1111 and determines all possible routes or paths from the starting location to reach the destination location. Routing module 1107 may generate a reference line in a form of a topographic map for each of the routes it determines from the starting location to reach the destination location. A reference line refers to an ideal route or path without any interference from others such as other vehicles, obstacles, or traffic condition. That is, if there is no other vehicle, pedestrians, or obstacles on the road, an ADV should exactly or closely follows the reference line. The topographic maps are then provided to decision module 1104 and/or planning module 1105. Decision module 1104 and/or planning module 1105 examine all of the possible routes to select and modify one of the most optimal routes in view of other data provided by other modules such as traffic conditions from localization module 1101, driving environment perceived by perception module 1102, and traffic condition predicted by prediction module 1103. The actual path or route for controlling the ADV may be close to or different from the reference line provided by routing module 1107 dependent upon the specific driving environment at the point in time.', '[0097]    Based on a decision for each of the objects perceived, planning module 1105 plans a path or route for the autonomous driving vehicle, as well as driving parameters (e.g., distance, speed, and/or turning angle), using a reference line provided by routing module 1107 as a basis. That is, for a given object, decision module 1104 decides what to do with the object, while planning module 1105 determines how to do it. For example, for a given object, decision module 1104 may decide to pass the object, while planning module 1105 may determine whether to pass on the left side or right side of the object. Planning and control data is generated by planning module 1105 including information describing how vehicle 1101 would move in a next moving cycle (e.g., next route/path segment). For example, the planning and control data may instruct vehicle 912 to move 10 meters at a speed of 30 miles per hour (mph), then change to a right lane at the speed of 25 mph.', '[0098]    Speed planner 1108 can be part of planning module 1105 or a separate module. Given a planned trajectory, speed planner 1108 guides the ADV to traverse along the planned path with a sequence of proper speeds v = [vi, ...], i ∈ [0, N], where vi = dsi/dt and dsi is the traverse distance along the path at t = i and dt is the sampling time.', '[0099]    Based on the planning and control data, control module 1106 controls and drives the autonomous driving vehicle, by sending proper commands or signals to vehicle control system 911, according to a route or path defined by the planning and control data. The planning and control data include sufficient information to drive the vehicle from a first point to a second point of a route or path using appropriate vehicle settings or driving parameters (e.g., throttle, braking, steering commands) at different points in time along the path or route.', '[0100]    In one embodiment, the planning phase is performed in a number of planning cycles, also referred to as driving cycles, such as, for example, in every time interval of 100 milliseconds (ms). For each of the planning cycles or driving cycles, one or more control commands will be issued based on the planning and control data. That is, for every 100 ms, planning module 1105 plans a next route segment or path segment, for example, including a target position and the time required for the ADV to reach the target position. Alternatively, planning module 1105 may further specify the specific speed, direction, and/or steering angle, etc. In one embodiment, planning module 1105 plans a route segment or path segment for the next predetermined period of time such as 5 seconds. For each planning cycle, planning module 1105 plans a target position for the current cycle (e.g., next 5 seconds) based on a target position planned in a previous cycle. Control module 1106 then generates one or more control commands (e.g., throttle, brake, steering control commands) based on the planning and control data of the current cycle.', '[0101]    Note that decision module 1104 and planning module 1105 may be integrated as an integrated module. Decision module 1104/planning module 1105 may include a navigation system or functionalities of a navigation system to determine a driving path for the autonomous driving vehicle. For example, the navigation system may determine a series of speeds and directional headings to affect movement of the autonomous driving vehicle along a path that substantially avoids perceived obstacles while generally advancing the autonomous driving vehicle along a roadway-based path leading to an ultimate destination. The destination may be set according to user inputs via user interface system 913. The navigation system may update the driving path dynamically while the autonomous driving vehicle is in operation. The navigation system can incorporate data from a GPS system and one or more maps so as to determine the driving path for the autonomous driving vehicle.', '[0102]    According to one embodiment, a system architecture of an autonomous driving system as described above includes, but it is not limited to, an application layer, a planning and control (PNC) layer, a perception layer, a device driver layer, a firmware layer, and a hardware layer. The application layer may include user interface or configuration application that interacts with users or passengers of an autonomous driving vehicle, such as, for example, functionalities associated with user interface system 913. The PNC layer may include functionalities of at least planning module 1105 and control module 1106. The perception layer may include functionalities of at least perception module 1102. In one embodiment, there is an additional layer including the functionalities of prediction module 1103 and/or decision module 1104. Alternatively, such functionalities may be included in the PNC layer and/or the perception layer. The firmware layer may represent at least the functionality of sensor system 915, which may be implemented in a form of a field programmable gate array (FPGA). The hardware layer may represent the hardware of the autonomous driving vehicle such as control system 911. The application layer, PNC layer, and perception layer can communicate with the firmware layer and hardware layer via the device driver layer.', '[0103]    Note that some or all of the components as shown and described above may be implemented in software, hardware, or a combination thereof. For example, such components can be implemented as software installed and stored in a persistent storage device, which can be loaded and executed in a memory by a processor (not shown) to carry out the processes or operations described throughout this application. Alternatively, such components can be implemented as executable code programmed or embedded into dedicated hardware such as an integrated circuit (e.g., an application specific IC or ASIC), a digital signal processor (DSP), or a field programmable gate array (FPGA), which can be accessed via a corresponding driver and/or operating system from an application. Furthermore, such components can be implemented as specific hardware logic in a processor or processor core as part of an instruction set accessible by a software component via one or more specific instructions.', '[0104]    Some portions of the preceding detailed descriptions have been presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the ways used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of operations leading to a desired result. The operations are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities.', \"[0105]    It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities.

The manual operation state indicates that the vehicle needs to receive a task and process the task under a control of a safety officer. The task may include, for example, a task of processing an order, where the order includes, but is not limited to, a passenger order and a freight order.', '[0021]    The vehicle 101 may acquire the vehicle state configuration information corresponding to the vehicle 101 from the server 104, the vehicle 102 may acquire the vehicle state configuration information corresponding to the vehicle 102 from the server 104, and the vehicle 103 may acquire the vehicle state configuration information corresponding to the vehicle 103 from the server 104.
