      "Systems and methods for using drones in dispersed welding applications are disclosed. In some examples, drones may be used in large and/or dispersed welding environments to quickly navigate the large distances and/or reach areas that might be more difficult for a person to reach. In some examples, the drones may use one or more attached devices to locate, identify, and/or collect information from welding equipment, welding workpieces, and/or welds within a (e.g., large and/or dispersed) welding environment. 1: This application claims priority to, and the benefit of, U. S. Provisional Application No. 62/893,934 , titled \"SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR USING DRONES IN DISPERSED WELDING ENVIRONMENTS,\" filed August 30, 2019, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by references. 2: The present disclosure generally relates to systems and methods for using drones and, more particularly, to systems and methods for using drones in dispersed welding environments. 3: Welding assets may be employed in large (and/or dispersed) welding environments, such as construction sites, factories, manufacturing yards, and shipyards, for example. In such large welding environments, traveling from one area to another can take a considerable amount of time. Additionally, some areas may be difficult for people to reach. 4: Limitations and disadvantages of conventional and traditional approaches will become apparent to one of skill in the art, through comparison of such systems with the present disclosure as set forth in the remainder of the present application with reference to the drawings. 5: The present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for using drones in dispersed welding environments, substantially as illustrated by and/or described in connection with at least one of the figures, and as set forth in the claims. 6: These and other advantages, aspects and novel features of the present disclosure, as well as details of an illustrated example thereof, will be more fully understood from the following description and drawings. 7: FIGS. 1a-1e depict various example drones that might be used in dispersed welding environments, in accordance with aspects of this disclosure. FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing components of the drones of FIGS. 1a-1e , in accordance with aspects of this disclosure. FIGS. 3a-3d depict the example drones of FIGS. 1a-1c with various example attached devices, in accordance with aspects of this disclosure. FIG. 4 shows an example drone as part of an example welding asset tracking system, in accordance with aspects of this disclosure. FIG. 5 shows various example welding assets, in accordance with aspects of this disclosure. FIG. 6 is a diagram illustrating an example welding area with example drones, in accordance with aspects of this disclosure. FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating an example drone program of the drone components of FIG. 2 , in accordance with aspects of this disclosure. 8: The figures are not necessarily to scale. Where appropriate, the same or similar reference numerals are used in the figures to refer to similar or identical elements. For example, reference numerals utilizing lettering (e.g., drone 100a, drone 100b) refer to instances of the same reference numeral that does not have the lettering (e.g., drone 100). 9: Some examples of the present disclosure relate to using drones in large and/or dispersed welding environments to quickly navigate the large distances and/or reach areas that might be more difficult for a person to reach. In some examples, one or more aerial, land, and/or aquatic drones may use one or more attached devices to locate, identify, and/or collect information from welding equipment, welding workpieces, and/or welds within a (e.g., large and/or dispersed) welding environment. In some examples, the collected information may be relayed to a device in communication with the drone. In some examples, one or more drones may additionally, or alternatively, use one or more tools to perform one or more welding related operations within the welding environment. 10: Some examples of the present disclosure relate to a method, comprising collecting welding information from welding equipment, a welding workpiece, or a weld, via a drone, and relaying the welding information from the drone to a monitoring device in communication with the drone. 11: In some examples, collecting the welding information comprises locating or identifying the welding equipment, welding workpiece, or weld via a detection device or communication circuitry of the drone. In some examples, the detection device comprises a radar, sonar, audio, thermal, global positioning, radiographic, camera, barcode reader, ultrasonic, or optical device. In some examples, the communication circuitry is configured for communication using a WiFi protocol, a Zigbee protocol, a short wavelength ultra high frequency protocol, a near field communication protocol, or a cellular communication protocol. 12: In some examples, collecting the welding information comprises using a collection device of the drone. In some examples, the collection device comprises a sensor. In some examples, the sensor comprises a radar, sonar, audio, thermal, radiographic, ultrasonic, optical, barcode, or camera sensor. In some examples, the collection device comprises communication circuitry. In some examples, the communication circuitry is configured for communication using WiFi protocol, a Zigbee protocol, a short wavelength ultra high frequency protocol, a near field communication protocol, or a cellular communication protocol. 13: In some examples, collecting the welding information comprises periodically collecting the welding information according to a stored schedule, or collecting the welding information in response to reception of a command signal. In some examples, relaying the welding information to the device comprises carrying or transmitting the welding information to the device. In some examples, the drone is an autonomous or remote controlled drone. In some examples, the drone is an aerial drone, aquatic drone, or ground drone. In some examples, the welding information comprises location information, identification information, display panel information, status information, maintenance information, fault information, weld process information, part tracking information, job tracking information, activity information, or quality information. 14: In some examples, the method further comprises determining a location of the welding equipment, welding workpiece, or weld, and relaying the welding information and the location from the drone to the monitoring device in communication with the drone. In some examples, the method further comprises comparing the welding information to expected welding information, and relaying an error or alert to the monitoring device in response to the welding information being different from the expected welding information. In some examples, the welding information comprises identification information, and the expected welding information comprises expected identification information. In some examples, wherein collecting the welding information comprises receiving an expected location of the welding equipment, welding workpiece, or weld from an asset tracking system, and maneuvering the drone to the expected location via a propulsion or navigation system of the drone. 15: Some examples of the present disclosure relate to a welding system, comprising a collection device configured to collect welding information, and a drone configured to carry the collection device, the drone comprising processing circuitry, and memory circuitry comprising non-transient computer readable instructions that, when executed, cause the processing circuitry to move the drone to a location proximate a welding equipment, a welding workpiece, or a weld, collect welding information from the welding equipment, welding workpiece, or weld using the collection device, and relay the welding information to a monitoring device in communication with the drone. In some examples, the memory circuitry further comprises a stored schedule, and moving the drone to the location comprises moving the drone according to the stored schedule. 16: FIGS. 1a-1e show several examples of drones 100. FIG. 1a shows an example of an aerial drone 100a. FIG. 1b shows an example of an aquatic drone 100b. FIGS. 1c-1e show examples of ground drones 100c. As shown, each drone 100 is a vehicle configured for propulsion via remote and/or autonomous control. Each drone 100 has a body 102 or hull 104 with an affixed propulsion system 106.

As shown, the drone memory circuitry 416 includes a drone program 700 and drone schedule 701, further discussed below with respect to FIG. 7 . 21: FIG. 2 shows various drone attachable devices 200 that may be coupled to the drones 100 (e.g., via the attachment ports 108). In some examples, one or more intermediary structures, mechanisms, fasteners, modules, etc. may be used to couple a drone attachable device 200 to the drone 100 (and/or attachment port 108). In some examples, a drone attachable devices 200 may be coupled to a drone 100 via two or more attachment ports 108. 22: In the example of FIG. 2 , the various drone attachable devices 200 include one or more drone sensors 212, communication hubs 206, grippers 210, marking tools 202, maintenance tools 204, welding tools 214, and/or welding equipment 208. In some examples, the drone sensors 212 may include radar, sonar, audio, thermal, global positioning, radiographic, camera, ultrasonic, barcode, and/or optical sensors. In some examples, the marking tools 202 may include lasers, paint sprayers, paint guns, and/or labelers. In some examples, the maintenance tools 204 may include screwdrivers, wrenches, reamers, vacuums, and/or air-blowers. In some examples, the welding tools 214 may include a welding torch, a grinder, and/or an induction heater. In some examples, the welding equipment may include welding-type power supplies, welding wire feeders, and/or shielding gas containers. In some examples, some maintenance tools 204 may also be used for welding operations (e.g., air blower may be coupled with shielding gas container to provide shielding gas during welding, vacuum may be used as a fume extractor during welding, etc.). 23: In some examples, the communication hub 206 may comprise hub communication circuitry configured to communicate with certain welding assets 500, location beacons 420, gateways 440, tags 480, servers 410, and/or mobile devices 404, discussed further below. In some examples, the communication hub 206 may comprise hub communication circuitry configured for shorter range communications such as, for example, via a short wavelength ultra-high frequency protocol (commonly referred to as Bluetooth), an IEEE 802.15.4 standard protocol (commonly referred to as Zigbee), a near field communication (NFC) protocol, and/or a radio frequency identification (RFID) protocol. In some examples, the communication hub 206 may comprise hub communication circuitry configured for longer range wireless communications, such as, for example, via a cellular and/or IEEE 802.11 standard (commonly referred to as WiFi) protocol. In some examples, the communication hub 206 may comprise hub communication circuitry configured for communication with a global positioning system (GPS). In some examples, the communication hub 206 may comprise hub communication circuitry configured for longer range and shorter range communication, and/or GPS. 24: FIGS. 3a-3d show drones 100 with various drone attachable devices 200 coupled to their attachment ports 108.
