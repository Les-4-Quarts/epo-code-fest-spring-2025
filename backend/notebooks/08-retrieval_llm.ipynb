      "This application provides a battery cell, a battery, and an electric apparatus. The battery cell (200) includes: an electrode assembly (30) including a body portion (31) and a tab (32), where the body portion (31) has a body end surface (311), and the tab (32) is led out of the body end surface (311); and a housing (40) having a first wall (401), where the first wall (401) is provided with an electrolyte injection hole (402) and an electrode terminal (43), and the tab (32) is electrically connected to the electrode terminal (43). At least one surface of the tab (32) is provided with a protection sheet (33), the protection sheet (33) shielding at least part of a region, on the body portion (31), corresponding to the electrolyte injection hole (402). 1: This application pertains to the field of battery technologies and more specifically relates to a battery cell, a battery, and an electric apparatus. 2: Energy saving and emission reduction are crucial to the sustainable development of the automobile industry. Electric vehicles, with their advantages in energy conservation and environmental protection, have become an important part of sustainable development of the automobile industry. For electric vehicles, battery technology is an important factor in connection with their development. 3: During manufacturing of a battery cell, after an electrode assembly is mounted in a housing body, an electrolyte needs to be injected through an electrolyte injection hole of an end cover. During injection, the electrolyte will impact the electrode assembly, resulting in damage to an electrode plate or separator, and thus causing damage to or short circuit of a cell. 4: Embodiments of this application are intended to provide a battery cell, a battery, and an electric apparatus, so as to solve the problem that in the related art, during injection, an electrolyte impacts an electrode assembly, thus causing damage to an electrode plate or separator. 5: According to a first aspect, an embodiment of this application provides a battery cell. The battery cell includes: an electrode assembly including a body portion and a tab, where the body portion has a body end surface, and the tab is led out of the body end surface; and a housing having a first wall, where the first wall is provided with an electrolyte injection hole and an electrode terminal, and the tab is electrically connected to the electrode terminal; where the body portion has a first region corresponding to the electrolyte injection hole, and at least one surface of the tab is provided with a protection sheet, the protection sheet shielding at least part of the first region. 6: In the technical solution of this embodiment of this application, the protection sheet is provided on the tab to protect the tab, and the protection sheet is made to shield at least part of the region, on the body portion of the electrode assembly, that corresponds to the electrolyte injection hole, so that during injection of an electrolyte, impact of the electrolyte on the body portion can be alleviated so as to well protect the electrode assembly, and the risk that an electrode plate or separator of the electrode assembly is broken through during injection of the electrolyte can be reduced or prevented. 7: In some embodiments, the protection sheet shields all of the first region. 8: All of the first region of the body portion is shielded by the protection sheet, so that during injection of the electrolyte, the electrolyte only impacts the protection sheet and does not directly flush the body portion of the electrode assembly, so as to well protect the body portion, further reducing or preventing the risk that the electrode plate or separator of the electrode assembly is broken through during injection of the electrolyte. 9: In some embodiments, the tab includes a tab root portion connected to the body portion and a tab body led out of the tab root portion, where width of the tab root portion is greater than width of the tab body, and the protection sheet is affixed to the tab root portion. 10: The tab root portion is provided to be connected to the body portion, and the width of the tab root portion is set to be greater than the width of the tab body, so that the current conducting capability of the tab can be enhanced. The tab body is provided to be connected to the electrode terminal on the first wall, so as to facilitate assembly and connection. The protection sheet is affixed to the tab root portion for the tab root portion to support the protection sheet, which can enhance strength of support to the protection sheet, so as to enhance flushing resistance against the electrolyte. 11: In some embodiments, a separator of the body portion exceeds the tab root portion in a direction in which the tab is led out. 12: The separator of the body portion is made to exceed the tab root portion so that the tab root portion is embedded inside the separator, so as to enhance insulation and isolation, thereby reducing or preventing the risk of short circuit in the body portion. 13: In some embodiments, the width of the tab root portion is greater than width of the protection sheet. 14: The width of the protection sheet being set to be less than the width of the tab root portion can save materials and reduce costs; and the protection sheet with a smaller width being used also facilitates assembly and improves assembly efficiency. 15: In some embodiments, the electrode assembly includes a first tab and a second tab of opposite polarities, where the first tab is made of a first conductive material, the second tab is made of a second conductive material, electrical conductivity of the first conductive material is less than electrical conductivity of the second conductive material, and the first tab has the tab root portion. 16: The electrical conductivity of the first conductive material for manufacturing the first tab is smaller. Providing the tab root portion on the first tab can enhance the current flow capacity of the first tab. In addition, the first tab can be set to be thinner to reduce space occupied, which in turn increases capacity density of the battery cell. 17: In some embodiments, the electrode assembly includes two tabs of opposite polarities, where the electrolyte injection hole is located between the two tabs, at least one of the tabs is provided with the protection sheet, and at least one protection sheet shields at least part of the first region. 18: The electrolyte injection hole being arranged between the two tabs can facilitate the provision of the protection sheet on any of the tabs and extension of the protection sheet to the region corresponding to the electrolyte injection hole, so that during injection of the electrolyte, the flushing to the body portion of the electrode assembly by the electrolyte can be alleviated, thereby facilitating the assembly. 19: In some embodiments, the tab has a first surface, the first surface being a surface of the tab facing away from the first wall; the protection sheet includes a first protection sheet affixed to the first surface, the first protection sheet shielding the first region; and the body portion has a first side surface adjacent to the body end surface; where the first protection sheet extends from the body end surface of the body portion to the first side surface. 20: The first protection sheet extending from the body end surface of the body portion to the first side surface can not only enhance the structural strength of the connection between the first protection sheet and the body portion, but also better protect the body end surface of the body portion, avoiding or alleviating the flushing of the electrolyte to the body end surface of the body portion, and in particular alleviating the flushing of the electrolyte to an edge of the body end surface close to the first side surface, so as to better protect the body portion. 21: In some embodiments, the first protection sheet covers the first surface of the tab. 22: The first protection sheet being made to cover the first surface of the tab can better protect the tab and enhance the structural strength of the connection between the first protection sheet and the tab. 23: In some embodiments, the tab has a second surface, the second surface being a surface of the tab close to the first wall; and the battery cell further includes a current collecting member connecting the second surface and the electrode terminal. 24: The current collecting member is provided to connect the second surface of the tab to the electrode terminal, so as to facilitate electrical connection between the tab and the electrode terminal. 25: In some embodiments, the protection sheet includes a second protection sheet disposed on the second surface, and the second surface has a connection region connected to the current collecting member, with the second protection sheet and the connection region staggered. 26: The second protection sheet is provided on the second surface of the tab to protect the tab, while the second protection sheet and the connection region are made to be staggered to facilitate connection of the tab to the current collecting member for easy assembly. 27: In some embodiments, the second protection sheet has an extension portion, where the extension portion extends to a position, corresponding to the connection region, on a surface of the current collecting member facing away from the tab. 28: The extension portion is provided on the second protection sheet to extend to the position, of the current collecting member, corresponding to the connection region, so that the current collecting member can be protected, and the structural strength of connection of the second protection sheet can be enhanced. 29: In some embodiments, the second protection sheet shields the first region. 30: During injection of the electrolyte, the above structural design enables the second protection sheet to buffer the electrolyte being injected to alleviate the flushing to the body portion, thus well protecting the body portion. 31: In some embodiments, the body portion has a second side surface adjacent to the body end surface; and the second protection sheet extends to the second side surface. 32: The second protection sheet extending to the second side surface can enhance the structural strength of the connection between the second protection sheet and the body portion, protect the connection between the tab and the body portion, especially when the tab is disposed, on the body end surface, apart from the second side surface, and also protect a region, on the body end surface, between the tab and the second side surface to avoid or alleviate the flushing of the electrolyte to this region, thereby better protecting the body portion. 33: In some embodiments, the battery cell includes a plurality of electrode assemblies, where the plurality of electrode assemblies are divided into two groups, and the tabs of two electrode assemblies adjacent to the electrolyte injection hole are each provided with the protection sheet. 34: The plurality of electrode assemblies being used can increase the capacity density of the battery cell, and also facilitate processing and manufacturing of the electrode assemblies. The protection sheets being provided on the tabs of the two electrode assemblies adjacent to the electrolyte injection hole can save materials and reduce costs. In addition, because the two electrode assemblies adjacent to the electrolyte injection hole are more susceptible to the impact of the electrolyte during injection of the electrolyte, the protection sheets being provided on the tabs of the two electrode assemblies can better allow the protection sheet to shield the region corresponding to the electrolyte injection hole, so as to protect the body portion of the electrode assembly. 35: In some embodiments, the protection sheets are affixed to surfaces, facing away from the first wall, of the two tabs adjacent to the electrolyte injection hole, and the protection sheet shields the first region of the electrode assembly in which the protection sheet is located. 36: The protection sheets being provided on the surfaces, facing away from the first wall, of the two tabs adjacent to the electrolyte injection hole can protect the tabs, and when the protection sheets are made to shield the region corresponding to the electrolyte injection hole, the protection sheet with a smaller area can be used to save the materials of the protection sheet and reduce the costs, and also facilitate mounting of the protection sheet due to the reduced area of the protection sheet used. 37: In some embodiments, the first wall is provided with a shield plate shielding the electrolyte injection hole, and an end, away from the body portion, of the protection sheet adjacent to the electrolyte injection hole is located on a side of the shield plate. 38: The shield plate is provided on the first wall to shield the electrolyte injection hole, which can provide buffering during injection of the electrolyte through the electrolyte injection hole. The end, away from the body portion, of the protection sheet adjacent to the electrolyte injection hole is located on a side of the shield plate, which allows the shield plate to extend between the ends, away from the body portion, of the two adjacent protection sheets, so that not only the electrolyte being injected can be buffered by the protection sheet, but also space utilization inside the housing can be improved, the capacity density of the battery cell can be improved, and the shield plate can be prevented from bursting the protection sheet. 39: In some embodiments, the protection sheets are disposed on surfaces, close to the first wall, of the tabs of the two electrode assemblies adjacent to the electrolyte injection hole. 40: When a plurality of electrode assemblies are provided, during injection, the electrolyte is more likely to flush the two electrode assemblies and tabs adjacent to the electrolyte injection hole, and the protection sheets being disposed on the surfaces, close to the first wall, of the two tabs adjacent to the electrolyte injection hole can provide good protection for the two tabs adjacent to the electrolyte injection hole, alleviating the flushing of the electrolyte to the tabs, and also alleviating the flushing of the electrolyte to the body portion due to the buffering of the protection sheet on the electrolyte. 41: In some embodiments, the protection sheets corresponding to the surfaces, close to the first wall, of the two tabs adjacent to the electrolyte injection hole are of a one-piece structure. 42: The protection sheets corresponding to the surfaces, close to the first wall, of the two tabs adjacent to the electrolyte injection hole being arranged as a one-piece structure allows the protection sheet to shield the region corresponding to the electrolyte injection hole to alleviate the impact of the electrolyte, thereby protecting the body portion of the electrode assembly. 43: In some embodiments, the protection sheets corresponding to the surfaces of the tabs close to the first wall are connected to corresponding tabs of the electrode assemblies. 44: The protection sheets being connected to corresponding tabs of the electrode assemblies facilitates the mounting and fixing of the protection sheets and improves the assembly efficiency. 45: In some embodiments, the body portion has a body side surface adjacent to the body end surface; and in a thickness direction of the body portion, an end of the protection sheet on the surface of the tab close to the first wall extends to the body side surface of the body portion adjacent to the end. 46: The end of the protection sheet on the surface, close to the first wall, of the tab extending to the body side surface of the body portion adjacent to the end can enhance the strength of the connection between the protection sheet and the corresponding body portion, and also provide good protection for the surface of the tab close to the first wall. 47: In some embodiments, the protection sheet and the tab are connected through adhesion; or the protection sheet and the tab are connected through ultrasonic welding. 48: The protection sheet and the tab being connected through adhesion facilitates both connection and assembly. The protection sheet and the tab being connected through ultrasonic welding can enhance the strength of the connection between the protection sheet and the tab. 49: According to a second aspect, an embodiment of this application provides a battery including the battery cell according to the foregoing embodiments. 50: According to a third aspect, an embodiment of this application provides an electric apparatus including the battery according to the foregoing embodiment. 51: The foregoing description is merely an overview of the technical solution of this application.

      "An ultrasonic instrument includes a housing, an ultrasonic transducer support by the housing, and an integrated usage indicator. The housing is configured to removably connect to a shaft assembly. The ultrasonic transducer is configured to be acoustically connected to a waveguide and operated a predetermined number of use cycles. The integrated usage indicator is operatively connected to the housing and includes a used state indicator. The used state indicator is configured to indicate to a clinician in a used state when the ultrasonic transducer has been operated at least the predetermined number of use cycles for limiting usage of the ultrasonic transducer to the predetermined number of use cycles. 1: Ultrasonic surgical instruments utilize ultrasonic energy for both precise cutting and controlled coagulation of tissue. The ultrasonic energy cuts and coagulates by vibrating a blade in contact with the tissue. Vibrating at frequencies of approximately 50 kilohertz (kHz), for example, the ultrasonic blade denatures protein in the tissue to form a sticky coagulum. Pressure exerted on the tissue with the blade surface collapses blood vessels and allows the coagulum to form a hemostatic seal. The precision of cutting and coagulation may be controlled by the surgeon's technique and adjusting the power level, blade edge, tissue traction, and blade pressure, for example. 2: Examples of ultrasonic surgical devices include the HARMONIC ACE® Ultrasonic Shears, the HARMONIC WAVE® Ultrasonic Shears, the HARMONIC FOCUS® Ultrasonic Shears, and the HARMONIC SYNERGY® Ultrasonic Blades, all by Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. of Cincinnati, Ohio.

Various ultrasonic surgical instruments enable the ultrasonic blade to be selectively attached and detached from the ultrasonic transducer, via a threaded coupling between the two components. It is desirable to apply an appropriate amount of torque to this threaded coupling when assembling the blade with the transducer. Applying too much torque can cause the threaded coupling to fracture and fail during use, and applying too little torque can cause the threaded coupling to loosen and inhibit effective transmission of ultrasonic energy to tissue during use. Either result is undesirable, and can render the surgical instrument ineffective or entirely inoperable. Ultrasonic blades and transducers of conventional ultrasonic surgical instruments may be assembled with a hand-held torque wrench tool that is provided separately from the surgical instrument. The torque wrench tool includes features that limit application of additional torque to the threaded coupling between the ultrasonic blade and transducer once a predetermined amount of torque has been reached. An example of such a torque wrench tool is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,059,210 , entitled \"Apparatus and Methods for Attaching and Detaching an Ultrasonic Actuated Blade/Coupler and an Acoustical Mount Therefor,\" issued Oct. 22, 1991, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. 4: While various types of ultrasonic surgical instruments and torque wrench mechanisms have been made and used, it is believed that no one prior to the inventor(s) has made or used the invention described herein. 5: The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention, and, together with the general description of the invention given above, and the detailed description of the embodiments given below, serve to explain the principles of the present invention.

      "In accordance with an embodiment, a method includes electronically receiving a media presentation description (MPD) from a network. The MPD describes multimedia content that includes alternative representations of a plurality of media types, and the MPD includes information indicative of how the alternative representations are encoded. The method also includes selecting one of the plurality of alternative representations for at least one of the plurality of media types based on information included in the MPD, requesting the selected one of the plurality of alternative representations piece-by-piece, and electronically receiving a piece of media data. 1: This patent application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/258,162 filed on November 4, 2009 , entitled \"HTTP Streaming,\" which application is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. 2: The present invention relates generally to communication systems, and more particularly to a system and method for Media Content Streaming. 3: As the capability of IP networks and network infrastructure has increased, and the quality of Internet-based video streaming technology has improved, the popularity of Internet streaming for video distribution has increased tremendously. One common method of implementing streaming video is transmitting the video program from a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server to a web-based HTTP client. Web-based streaming video is pervasive because of the simplicity of access, in that a user simply clicks on a link to view video content. 4: Video streaming technology faces some difficulties, however. In some cases, when a user requests video content, there can be a considerable delay before the content starts playing. In some cases, streaming video content is interrupted or stalled because of heavy network and/or poor link conditions. In other cases, even if the network link initially starts out good, the viewing experience may be later degraded due to changing network conditions. 5: In accordance with an embodiment, a method includes electronically receiving a media presentation description (MPD) from a network. The MPD describes multimedia content that includes alternative representations of a plurality of media types, and the MPD includes information indicative of how the alternative representations are encoded. The method also includes selecting one of the plurality of alternative representations for at least one of the plurality of media types based on information included in the MPD, requesting the selected one of the plurality of alternative representations piece-by-piece, and electronically receiving a piece of media data. 6: The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features of an embodiment of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the invention that follows may be better understood. Additional features and advantages of embodiments of the invention will be described hereinafter, which form the subject of the claims of the invention. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the conception and specific embodiments disclosed may be readily utilized as a basis for modifying or designing other structures or processes for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention. It should also be realized by those skilled in the art that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. 7: For a more complete understanding of the present invention, and the advantages thereof, reference is now made to the following descriptions taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing, in which: Figure 1 illustrates a media streaming system; Figure 2 illustrates an embodiment data structure; Figure 3 illustrates an embodiment media presentation description (MPD) structure; and Figure 4 illustrates a computer system for implementing embodiment methods. 8: Corresponding numerals and symbols in the different figures generally refer to corresponding parts unless otherwise indicated. The figures are drawn to clearly illustrate the relevant aspects of the embodiments and are not necessarily drawn to scale. 9: The making and using of various embodiments are discussed in detail below. It should be appreciated, however, that the present invention provides many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention, and do not limit the scope of the invention. 10: The present invention will be described with respect to embodiments in specific contexts, for example, a system and method for media content streaming. In particular, some embodiments relate to streaming of media content based on the HTTP protocol. 11: Figure 1 illustrates HTTP-based media content streaming system 100 that implements concepts and methods of the present invention. System 100 has HTTP streaming server 102 that transmits streaming media to HTTP streaming client 106 via IP network 104. It should be appreciated that alternative embodiments can also be directed toward other streaming systems besides HTTP streaming systems. 12: Embodiments of the present invention utilize systems and methods for HTTP streaming of multimedia streams of audio and/or video and/or other media types. These systems and methods offer flexible and efficient support of on-demand and live streaming based on a storage method, a media presentation description (MPD), and use of HTTP GET requests with or without byte ranges. In the MPD, the byte range and time range of a media segment may be included, such that clients can efficiently request media segments using byte ranges only. The MPD may include additional codec information for a media alternative representation for support of media contents encoded with more than one encoding configuration. For example MPD 202 in Figure 2 points to alternative representations 204, 206, 208 and 210. Each of these alternative representations can encompass a single file or multiple files of media content data, wherein each file is associated with a unique uniform resource locator (URL). 13: A maximum length of all segments can be included in the MPD to enable use of byte range without signaling of byte ranges in the MPD and a greatly reduced size of MPD, which implies low startup delay for the streaming process. To indicate the end of a live streaming session, the server can compose the next expected file or segment in an abnormal way, e.g. making the file or segment empty. To enable tuning into a live streaming session and start to request the latest content, a special file name and consequently a special URL is used for the file containing the latest segment available in the streaming server. To enable a client figure out which file to start with when it wants to seek to a specific temporal position while segment duration is constant and there are no byte offsets and no time offsets signaled for each segment in the MPD, the URL of a file can be formed to be capable of indicating the starting playback time of the file. Efficient streaming processes that enable normal streaming processes like setup, pause, resume, and stop, as well as seeking, fast forward, fast rewind and stream adaption processes are provided. 14: Figure 3 illustrates MPD structure 300 according to one embodiment of the present invention. MPD 300 has byte range and time range information 302, segment duration information 304, fast forward and rewind information 306, URL information 308, and frame rate information 310. In some embodiments, other information 312 can be included. In alternative embodiments, a subset of the MPD structure 300 can be used. 15: Figure 4 illustrates computer system 400 adapted to use embodiments of the present invention, e.g., storing and/or executing software associated with the embodiments. Central processing unit (CPU) 401 is coupled to system bus 402. CPU 401 may be any general purpose CPU. However, embodiments of the present invention are not restricted by the architecture of CPU 401 as long as CPU 401 supports the inventive operations as described herein. Bus 402 is coupled to random access memory (RAM) 403, which may be SRAM, DRAM, or SDRAM. ROM 404 is also coupled to bus 402, which may be PROM, EPROM, or EEPROM. RAM 403 and ROM 404 hold user and system data and programs as is well known in the art. 16: Bus 402 is also coupled to input/output (I/O) adapter 405, communications adapter 411, user interface 408, and multimedia adaptor 409. The I/O adapter 405 connects storage devices 406, such as one or more of a hard drive, a CD drive, a floppy disk drive, a tape drive, to computer system 400. The I/O adapter 405 is also connected to a printer (not shown), which would allow the system to print paper copies of information such as documents, photographs, articles, and the like. Note that the printer may be a printer, e.g., dot matrix, laser, and the like, a fax machine, scanner, or a copier machine. User interface adaptor is coupled to keyboard 413 and mouse 407, as well as other devices. Multimedia adapter 409, which can be a display and/or audio card in some embodiments, is connected to display device 410 and audio device 415. Display device 410 can be a CRT, flat panel display, or other type of display device, and audio device 415 can be a loudspeaker, headphones, or other analog or digital audio system. 17: In some embodiments, HTTP streaming refers to streaming of multimedia contents based on the HTTP protocol. 3GPP supports streaming delivery since Release 4 of its specifications. 3GPP TS 26.234 specifies streaming delivery based on RTSP and RTP over UDP. HTTP streaming is spreading widely as the form of delivery of Internet video, and there is a trend towards using HTTP as the main protocol for multimedia delivery. In alternative embodiments, other streaming systems and standards can be used. 18: Technical reasons for the popularity of HTTP streaming include the ability to use standard servers and standard HTTP caches (or cheap servers in general) to deliver the content, so that it can be delivered from a CDN or any other standard server farm, the ability to move control of \"streaming session\" entirely to the client, which basically only opens one or several TCP connections to one or several standard HTTP servers or caches HTTP steaming is also popular because it enables easy and effortless streaming services by avoiding NAT and firewall traversal issues. 19: One approach for HTTP streaming is referred to as the static content serving mode. In this mode, the standard HTTP Server is used without any extension. Content is offered as a file or a collection of files that are available on an HTTP server. The client acquires the content by accessing the files using HTTP GET request with or without byte ranges. 20: At least the following problems are unsolved from existing solutions for HTTP streaming based on the above approach. First, using time ranges in HTTP GET requests is convenient for a client to request media data from a streaming server. However, existing standard HTTP servers understand byte ranges but do not understand time ranges. 21: Second, there lacks a way to signal in an MPD the information of more than one encoding configuration for a media alternative representation. Third, to enable low startup delay, it is preferable to have a small-sized MPD. Thus, in some cases, it would be desirable not to have file or media segment specific information in the MPD, as a presentation may be split into a large number of files in the time dimension. However, there lacks a way to enable the client meaningfully request media segments without file or media segment specific information in the MPD, such as time ranges and/or byte ranges. 22: Fourth, when a live streaming session is ended, the server should inform the clients such that they don't continue trying and failing, which causes annoying user experiences. One way to notify this to clients is to use a timely updated MPD. However, this requires that the MPD update be timely received by the client, which consumes additional resources on the client, which is burdensome when using a static MPD is desired and possible. 23: Fifth, when tuning to a live streaming, a client would typically like to start receiving the latest content. One way to do this is to tell information of the URL and/or byte range of the latest media segment through a timely updated MPD. However, this requires that the MPD update be timely received by the client, which consumes additional resources on the client, which is burdensome when using a static MPD is desired and possible. 24: Sixth, when segment duration is constant and there are no byte offsets and no time offsets signaled for each segment in the MPD, a client cannot figure out which file to start with when it wants to seek to a specific temporal position. Finally, there lacks a mechanism for support of fast forward and fast rewind in HTTP streaming. 25: To address the above problems, the following new features are among those provided by embodiments of the invention. First, in the MPD, the byte range and time range of a media segment may be included, such that clients can efficiently request media segments using byte ranges only. Second the MPD may include additional codec information for a media alternative representation for support of media contents encoded with more than one encoding configuration. 26: Third, a maximum length of all segments can be included in the MPD to enable use of byte range without signaling of byte ranges in the MPD and a greatly reduced size of MPD, which implies low startup delay for the streaming process. Fourth, to indicate the end of a live streaming session, the server can compose the next expected file or segment in an abnormal way, e.g. making the file or segment empty. Fifth, to enable tuning into a live streaming session and start to request the latest content, a special file name and consequently a special URL is used for the file containing the latest segment available in the streaming server. 27: Sixth, a URL prefix for an alternative representation is given. The URL of a file containing one or more segments of an alternative representation is the concatenation of the URL prefix for the alternative representation and the corresponding file index value, e.g. in the form of five decimal digits, e.g., 00000, 00005, 00012, and so on. For each alternative representation, the file index value for the first file (the one containing a 'moov' box) is equal to 0, and the file index value for other files is equal to the segment index value of the first segment contained in the file, which is equal to the sequence number field found in the movie fragment header box of the movie fragment corresponding to the first segment contained in the file. This way, when segment duration is constant and there are no byte offsets and no time offsets signaled for each segment in the MPD, a client can figure out which file to start with when it wants to seek to a specific temporal position. 28: Finally, efficient streaming processes that enable normal streaming processes like setup, pause, resume, and stop, as well as seeking, fast forward, fast rewind and stream adaption processes are provided. 29: Embodiments of the present invention incorporate an approach for the Static Content Serving Mode of HTTP Streaming, including file storage, media presentation description, and streaming processes for both on-demand streaming and live streaming. 30: Regarding file storage, the media presentation description (MPD) is stored in a separate file by its own in some embodiments. In one embodiment, media files are stored such that each file contains one or more segments of one alternative representation. For example, in some embodiments, a file may contain and only contain one or more segments of one audio alternative representation, a file may contain and only contain one or more segments of one video alternative representation, a file may contain and only contain one or more segments of one audio-video alternative representation consisting of one audio alternative representation and one video representation. However, in one embodiment, a file does contain one or more segments of more than one video alternative representation, and does not contain one or more segments of more than one audio alternative representation. 31: In an embodiment, the first segment of one alternative representation contains the 'ftyp' box and the 'moov' box, but does not contain a 'moof box. In the 'moov' box, in one embodiment, no media sample is documented, i.e., entry count in the each 'stts' box contained in the 'moov' box shall be equal to 0, and sample count in each 'stsz' or 'stz2' box contained in the 'moov' box shall be equal to 0. As there is no sample documented in the first segment, there does not need to be an associated 'mdat' box. In an embodiment, any other segment than the first segment contains exactly one movie fragment. Alternatively, more than one movie fragment can be used. Furthermore, for any other segment than the first segment, the metadata ('moof box etc.) and the media data ('mdat' box) shall be stored in the same file. 32: For some alternative representations, partitioning of media samples into segments is temporally aligned, such that the n-th segment of alternative representation A covers the same time period of any other alternative representation B. There may be an exception for fast forward and fast rewind alternative representations, for which one segment covers an integer number of segments in those alternative representations for normal playback. 33: An alternative to the above storage approach (referred to as storage approach 1) is to have one \"giant\" 'moov' box containing the first segments of alternative representations and this is stored in a separate file as its own, while other segments of alternative representations are stored as in the above storage approach. This alternative approach is referred to as storage approach 2. For both storage approaches 1 and 2, the MPD may also be included in the 'moov' box, or referenced by a URL included in the 'moov' box. 34: For live streaming, in addition to the above specifications, the following applies: In one embodiment, when H.264/AVC video is in use, parameter sets is stored in\n",

      "A syringe barrel grip 30 of the present invention is attached to a syringe barrel 20 including a flange 22 in which a pair of flange straight portions 24 and 24 is formed. A flange housing portion 32 of the grip 30 includes a flange rotation restricting portion 35 that restricts relative rotation between the grip 30 and the flange 22 that has entered the flange rotation restricting portion 35 by rotating the barrel 20 by a predetermined angle in a state where the flange 22 is housed in a flange insertion portion 34, and there is a gap 40 for allowing a sterilization gas to flow between a lower inner peripheral surface of the grip 30 and the barrel 20 in a state where the flange 22 is housed in the flange rotation restricting portion 35. 1: The present invention relates to a syringe barrel grip attached to a syringe barrel, and a barrel assembly and a syringe each including the syringe barrel grip. 2: Some drug-filled syringes (prefilled syringes) each use a plunger that is not coupled to a gasket in order to prevent medical errors. To such a prefilled syringe, a clip (backstop) for preventing a plunger from moving to a proximal end side and falling off from a barrel is attached (Patent Literature 1). 3: In addition, in order to facilitate gripping and operation of a syringe, it is also known to attach a clip (grip) including a finger hook portion protruding outward to a proximal end portion of a barrel (Patent Literature 2) . 4: These clips are each fitted to an outer peripheral surface of a barrel at a cylindrical fitting portion and firmly attached to a syringe so as not to rattle or come off during operation of the syringe. 5: Patent Literature 1: JP 2015-517860 A ( US 2015-105734 A1 and US 2019-365565 A1 ) Patent Literature 2: WO 2017/073658 A ( US 2018-243509 A1 ) 6: In recent years, in ophthalmic use and the like, higher sterility of not only a drug to be administered and a portion in contact with the drug but also the entire prefilled syringe including a grip is required. Therefore, the present inventors have studied an application of a surface sterilization method with a small heat load, such as hydrogen peroxide sterilization, EOG sterilization, or NO2 sterilization, to a prefilled syringe to which a grip is attached. These surface sterilization methods perform sterilization with a gas (sterilization gas), and in order to achieve higher sterility, the sterilization gas preferably comes into contact with a wider area of a surface of the prefilled syringe. 7: Therefore, the present invention provides a syringe barrel grip having good operability and capable of achieving higher sterility in a state of being attached to a syringe barrel, and a barrel assembly and a syringe each including such a syringe barrel grip. 8: The above object is achieved by the following. 9: A syringe barrel grip attached to a syringe barrel including a cylindrical body and a flange disposed in the cylindrical body, protruding outward, and including a pair of flange straight portions facing each other in parallel, the grip including a flange housing portion that houses the flange, in which the flange housing portion includes: a side surface opening formed on a side surface of the grip; a flange insertion portion extending in an internal direction of the grip from the side surface opening; and a flange rotation restricting portion that communicates with the flange insertion portion, extends into the grip, and restricts relative rotation between the grip and the flange that has entered the flange rotation restricting portion by rotating the barrel by a predetermined angle in a state where the flange is housed in the flange insertion portion, the flange insertion portion includes a first pair of grip straight portions having a slightly wider width than the pair of flange straight portions, and the flange rotation restricting portion includes a second pair of grip straight portions having a slightly wider width than the pair of flange straight portions and is inclined with respect to the first pair of grip straight portions, in a state where the flange is housed in the flange rotation restricting portion, front sides of the pair of flange straight portions are located in the second pair of grip straight portions, and rear sides of the pair of flange straight portions are located in the first pair of grip straight portions, and in a state where the flange of the barrel is housed in the flange rotation restricting portion of the grip, a lower inner peripheral surface of the grip is not in contact with the barrel, and there is a gap for allowing a sterilization gas to flow between the lower inner peripheral surface of the grip and the barrel. 10: The above object is also achieved by the following. 11: A barrel assembly including: a syringe barrel including a cylindrical body and a flange disposed at a proximal end of the cylindrical body, protruding outward, and including a pair of flange straight portions facing each other in parallel; and the syringe barrel grip attached to the barrel. 12: The above object is also achieved by the following. 13: A syringe including: the barrel assembly; a gasket slidably housed in the barrel; and a plunger for moving the gasket. 14: Fig. 1 is a front view illustrating an embodiment of a syringe of the present invention.

Fig. 18 is a cross-sectional explanatory view corresponding to Fig. 10 for explaining a syringe barrel grip according to another embodiment of the present invention. 15: A syringe barrel grip of the present invention, and a barrel assembly and a syringe each including such a syringe barrel grip will be described with reference to an embodiment illustrated in the drawings. 16: Note that the present embodiment will be described by defining an upper side in Fig. 1 (the side on which a flange 22 of a syringe barrel 20 is formed) as a proximal end side or an upper side, defining a lower side in Fig. 1 (the side on which a nozzle portion 23 of the syringe barrel 20 is disposed) as a distal end side or a lower side, and defining the vertical direction in Fig. 1 as an axial direction (the axial direction of the syringe barrel 20 or a cylindrical body 21). 17: As illustrated in Figs. 1 to 6 , a syringe 1 of the present invention includes: a barrel assembly 2 including a syringe barrel 20 (hereinafter, also simply referred to as a barrel 20) and a syringe barrel grip 30 (hereinafter, also simply referred to as a grip 30) attached to the barrel 20; a gasket 11 slidably housed in the barrel 20; and a plunger 12 for moving the gasket 11. 18: The barrel 20 includes a cylindrical body 21 and a flange 22 (thickness t) disposed in the cylindrical body 21, protruding outward (in a direction orthogonal to the axial direction of the barrel 20), and including a pair of flange straight portions 24 and 24 (width w) facing each other in parallel. In the present embodiment, the cylindrical body 21 of the barrel 20 has a circular (annular) outer shape and a circular (annular) inner shape in a cross section taken along a plane orthogonal to the axial direction thereof as a whole. A distal end opening portion (nozzle portion) 23 for discharging a drug is disposed at a distal end portion of the barrel 20. 19: In addition, the barrel 20 includes a collar 25 covering a proximal end side portion of the nozzle portion 23. A barrel side screwing portion (female screwing portion) is formed on an inner surface of the collar 25. 20: The nozzle portion 23 is sealed by a seal cap 13 to prevent leakage of a drug 60 stored in the barrel 20 and to prevent the aseptically filled drug 60 from coming into contact with outside air. 21: Examples of a constituent material of the barrel 20 include various resins such as a polyolefin including polyethylene and polypropylene, polystyrene, polyamide, polycarbonate, polyvinyl chloride, poly-(4-methylpentene-1), an acrylic resin, an acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer, a polyester including polyethylene terephthalate, a cyclic polyolefin polymer, and a cyclic olefin copolymer. Among these resins, resins such as polypropylene, a cyclic polyolefin polymer, and a cyclic olefin copolymer are preferable because the resins are easily molded and have heat resistance. Note that a cyclic olefin polymer or a cyclic olefin copolymer having high transparency such that a drug solution filled inside can be visually confirmed from the outside and having heat resistance capable of withstanding high-pressure steam sterilization is particularly preferable as a material for forming the barrel 20. 22: The seal cap 13 includes a body portion 18 having a proximal end side hollow portion that houses the nozzle portion 23 of the barrel 20, and a seal member 19 housed in the body portion 18 and disposed at a distal end portion of the proximal end side hollow portion. In addition, on an outer surface of the proximal end side hollow portion, a cap side screwing portion (male screwing portion) capable of being screwed with the barrel side screwing portion (female screwing portion) formed on an inner surface of the collar 25 is formed. 23: Examples of a material for forming the seal cap include various resins such as polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, polyamide, polycarbonate, polyvinyl chloride, poly-(4-methylpentene-1), an acrylic resin, an acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer, a polyester including polyethylene terephthalate, and a cyclic polyolefin. Among these resins, resins such as polypropylene and a cyclic polyolefin are preferable because the resins are easily molded and have heat resistance. 24: As a material for forming the seal member 19, an elastic material such as a natural rubber, a synthetic rubber including an isoprene rubber, a butyl rubber, a butadiene rubber, a fluororubber, and a silicone rubber, or a thermoplastic elastomer including an olefin-based elastomer and a styrene-based elastomer is preferable. 25: The gasket 11 housed in the barrel 20 is made of an elastic rubber or a synthetic resin. The gasket 11 includes a substantially cylindrical body portion extending with substantially the same outer diameter and a plurality of annular ribs disposed on an outer surface of the body portion. Outer surfaces of the annular ribs are in liquid-tight contact with an inner surface of the barrel 20 and are slidable in a liquid-tight state. 26: As a material for forming the gasket 11, it is preferable to use an elastic rubber (for example, a butyl rubber, a latex rubber, or a silicone rubber), a synthetic resin (for example, a styrene-based elastomer such as an SBS elastomer or an SEBS elastomer, or an olefin-based elastomer such as an ethylene-a olefin copolymer elastomer), or the like. 27: The plunger 12 is made of a hard or semi-hard resin. In this embodiment, the plunger 12 includes a small disk-shaped gasket pressing portion 14 disposed at a distal end thereof, a disk-shaped pressing operation portion 15 disposed at a proximal end thereof, and a shaft portion 16 having a cross-shaped cross section and extending in the axial direction of the barrel 20 between the gasket pressing portion 14 and the pressing operation portion 15. Note that the shaft portion 16 may be a columnar shaft. The columnar shaft may have a rod shape, a circular columnar shape, a polygonal columnar shape, a circular cylindrical shape, a polygonal cylindrical shape, or the like. 28: In this embodiment, the plunger 12 is not connected to the gasket 11, and can abut on a proximal end portion of the gasket 11 at the gasket pressing portion 14. The gasket 11 can be moved to a distal end side by pressing after abutment. 29: A distal end side portion (the gasket pressing portion 14 and a part of a distal end side of the shaft portion 16) of the plunger 12 is housed in the barrel 20 (cylindrical body 21). The plunger 12 includes a stopper portion 17 that is disposed in a portion (shaft portion 16) housed in the barrel 20, abuts on the grip 30 (stopper abutment portion 31) described in detail later, and restricts detachment of the plunger 12 from the barrel 20. More specifically, the stopper portion 17 has a disk shape having an outer shape (outer diameter) smaller than the inner shape (inner diameter) of the barrel 20 (cylindrical body 21) and larger than the outer shape (maximum diameter portion) of the shaft portion 16 of the plunger 12. 30: As a constituent material of the plunger 12, a hard or semi-hard resin such as high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, or polyethylene terephthalate is preferably used. 31: In the syringe 1, the drug (drug solution) 60 is stored (filled) in the barrel 20 (in a space formed between the seal cap 13 and the gasket 11). 32: The drug 60 to be stored is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include a vitamin, a sugar, an electrolyte, an organic acid, a mineral, a fat emulsion, an amino acid, a protein, and an organ preparation mainly as nutrients. Examples thereof further include a drug for a central nervous system, such as a general anesthetic, an antipyretic analgesic, or a general cold preparation, a drug for a peripheral nervous system, such as a local anesthetic or a muscle relaxant, a drug for a sensory organ, such as an ophthalmic agent, a metabolic drug such as a circulatory drug, a respiratory drug, a digestive drug, an urogenital anal drug, a hormonal agent, an antibiotic, or a diabetes drug, a biological preparation such as an antitumor drug, an allergic drug, an antibacterial agent, or an antiviral agent, and a prescription drug such as distilled water or physiological saline mainly as therapeutic agents. Examples thereof further include a vaccine mainly as a preventive agent and a contrast agent mainly as a diagnostic agent. 33: Many of the exemplified drugs each contain, as a main component, a synthetic low molecular weight compound, a synthetic middle molecular weight compound, a biopharmaceutical such as a polypeptide preparation or a protein preparation, or a biologically derived pharmaceutical such as a blood preparation, but these substances can be used as drugs regardless of the applications described above. In addition, a substance corresponding to a molecular target drug such as an antibody can also be used as a drug. A dosage form of each of these drugs is preferably a liquid even in a drug having a solid dosage form such as a powder or a granule in addition to a liquid from a viewpoint of usability. 34: In addition, as the drug 60, an ophthalmic drug that can be administered by puncture can be used. Examples of a specific target disease for which such an ophthalmic drug is used include choroidal neovascularization, age-related macular degeneration (both exudative and atrophic), macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO) (including both branch retinal vein occlusion (bRVO) and central retinal vein occlusion (cRVO)), choroidal neovascularization secondary to pathologic myopia (PM), diabetic macular edema (DME), diabetic retinopathy, and proliferative retinopathy. Examples of the drug to be used include ranibizumab [trade name: LUCENTIS (registered trademark)], bevacizumab [trade name: AVASTIN (registered trademark)], and aflibercept [trade name: EYLEA (registered trademark)], which are anti-VEGF antibodies used as therapeutic agents for age-related macular degeneration, and conbercept known as VEGF-TrapEye (aflibercept intravitreal injection solution). 35: The structure of the syringe barrel grip 30 of the present invention will be described with reference to the embodiment illustrated in Figs. 1 to 14 . 36: The syringe barrel grip 30 of this embodiment includes a flange housing portion 32 that houses the flange 22. As illustrated in Fig. 2 , the flange housing portion 32 includes: a side surface opening 33 formed on a side surface of the grip 30; a flange insertion portion 34 extending in an internal direction of the grip 30 from the side surface opening 33; and a flange rotation restricting portion 35 that communicates with the flange insertion portion 34, extends into the grip 30, and restricts relative rotation between the grip 30 and the flange 22 that\n",

      "A liquid crystal display comprises a backlight module comprising a reflective polarizing film, a light control film and a liquid crystal panel disposed between the backlight module and the light control film. The light control film comprises a light input surface and a light output surface opposite the light input surface and alternating transmissive and absorptive regions disposed between the light input surface and the light output surface. The absorptive regions have an aspect ratio of at least 30. 1: This invention relates to liquid crystal displays comprising a light control film. 2: Light control films, such as louver films, are often incorporated into automotive liquid crystal displays (LCDs) to minimize reflection. Typically, the light control film is placed behind the liquid crystal (LC) panel next to or laminated directly to the rear polarizing film. 3: Briefly, in one aspect, the present invention provides a liquid crystal display comprising (a) a backlight module comprising a reflective polarizing film; (b) a light control film comprising a light input surface and a light output surface opposite the light input surface, and alternating transmissive and absorptive regions disposed between the light input surface and the light output surface, wherein the absorptive regions have an aspect ratio of at least 30; and (c) a liquid crystal panel disposed between the backlight module and the light control film. 4: In another aspect, A liquid crystal display comprising (a) a backlight module; (b) a light control film comprising a light input surface and a light output surface opposite the light input surface, and alternating transmissive and absorptive regions disposed between the light input surface and the light output surface; (c) a liquid crystal panel disposed between the backlight module and the light control film; and (d) a diffuse layer laminated on the light input surface of the light control film, wherein the diffuse layer has a clarity of less than 70% and a haze of less than 60%. 5: Surprisingly, the LCDs of the invention, which have light control film on the \"front\" (i.e., viewer's side) of the LC panel, provide a significant increase in display brightness compared to LCDs of the prior art, which have light control film behind the LC panel. 6: FIG. 1 is a cross-section view of a LCF. FIG. 2 is a perspective view of a microstructured film article. FIG. 3 is a perspective view of a LCF. FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a LCF. FIG. 5 is a cross-section view of a LCF. FIG. 6A is a cross-section view of a LCF. FIG. 6B depicts the polar cut-off viewing angle of the LCF of FIG. 6A. FIG. 7 is a perspective view of a microstructured film. FIG. 8 is a cross-section view of a LCF further comprising a cover film bonded with an adhesive layer. FIG. 9 is a cross-section view of a LCD of the prior art. FIG. 10 is a cross-section view of a LCD of the invention. FIG. 11 is a cross-section view of a LCD of the invention. FIG. 12 is a cross-section view of a LCD of the invention. FIG. 13 is a plot of luminance versus viewing angle. FIG. 14 is a plot of luminance versus viewing angle. 7: Backlight modules provide illumination for the LCDs. The LCDs of the present invention can comprise any useful backlight module. A typical backlight module may comprise, for example, a light source, back reflector, light guide, diffuser, light collimating film(s) such as prismatic film(s) and a reflective polarizer. 8: The light source can be any useful light source, but in some embodiments the light source is a light emitting diode (LED). A plurality of LEDs can be arranged along an edge of the backlight module to emit light into an edge of the lightguide. The lightguide uses total internal reflection (TIR) to transport or guide light from the edge mounted LEDs across the entire length of the lightguide to the opposite edge of the backlight. A diffuser sheet can be utilized to further disperse the light. Light management films such as a reflective material disposed behind or below the lightguide, and prismatic brightness enhancement films (BEFs) and a reflective polarizing film disposed in front of or above the lightguide can be used to increase on-axis brightness. 9: The back reflector can be a predominately specular, diffuse or combination specular/diffuse reflector. In some embodiments, the back reflector can be a semi-specular reflector. Suitable high reflectivity materials include, for example, Enhanced Specular Reflector (ESR) multilayer polymeric film from 3M Company and white reflective films. 10: Prismatic BEF films, such as those available from 3M Company ensure that the light is directed toward the viewer. 11: The reflective polarizer recycles scattered light to increase efficiency. Any suitable reflective polarizer can be used for the reflective polarizer. For example, multilayer optical film (MOF) reflective polarizers, diffusely reflective polarizing film (DRPF) such as continuous/disperse phase polarizers, wire grid polarizers or cholesteric polarizers. MOF and continuous /disperse phase reflective polarizers rely on the difference in refractive index between at least two materials, usually polymeric materials, to selectively reflect light of one polarization state while transmitting light in an orthogonal polarization state. MOF DBEF reflective polarizers are available from 3M Company. 12: The LC panel typically includes a layer of LC disposed between glass plates. The glass plates can include electrode structures and alignment layers on their inner surfaces for controlling the orientation of the LCs in the LC layer. The electrode structures are commonly arranged to define LC panel pixels. A color filter may also be included with one or more of the plates. The LC structure is positioned between an upper absorbing polarizer and a lower absorbing polarizer. As used herein, references to a \"liquid crystal panel\" or \"LC panel\" include the upper absorbing polarizer and the lower absorbing polarizer (i.e., as used herein, \"liquid crystal panel\" or \"LC panel\" means liquid crystal disposed between glass plates and positioned between two absorbing polarizers). 13: The liquid crystal displays of the invention include a light control film (\"LCF\") on the frontside (i.e., the viewer's side) of the LC panel. The LC panel is disposed between the backlight module and the light control film. Useful LCFs include louver films such as those described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 8,503,122 (Liu et al. ), 8,213,082 (Gaides et al. ), 6,905,219 (Gaides ), 8,133,572 (Gaides et al. ), 8,012,567 (Gaides et al. ), 9,063,284 (Jones et al. ), 9,335,449 (Gaides et al. ) and 9,804,311 (Gaides et al. ) and co-pending publication WO 2019/118685 . 14: LCFs are often made to ensure that the absorptive regions absorb as much of the incident light as possible. Highly absorptive regions minimize the amount of light that may \"leak\" through these regions, and therefore control the directionality and the function of the LCF. 15: The brightness of the display can be increased when incident light undergoes TIR from the interface between the absorptive and transmissive regions. Whether a light ray will undergo TIR or not, can be determined from the incidence angle with the interface, and the difference in refractive index of the materials used in the transmissive and absorptive regions. 16: FIG. 1 shows a cross-sectional view of an LCF 100 that includes a light output surface 120 and a light input surface 110 opposite light output surface 120. LCF 100 includes alternating transmissive regions 130, absorptive regions 140, and an interface 150 between transmissive regions 130 and absorptive regions 140. Transmissive regions 130 have a base width \"W\" disposed apart from each other by a pitch \"P\", and include a land region \"L\" between absorptive regions 140 and light output surface 120. Absorptive regions 140 have a base 145, a height \"H\" and are displaced apart from each other by pitch \"P\". Interface 150 forms an interface angle θI with a normal 160 to light output surface 120. As described herein, by \"normal\" to a surface is meant perpendicular to the surface. LCF 100 includes an internal viewing cutoff angle ΦI defined by the geometry of alternating transmissive regions 130 and absorptive regions 140. 17: FIG. 2 shows a microstructured film article 200 comprising at least one microstructured surface 210, which can be used to make an LCF. In one case, microstructured surface 210 can include a plurality of grooves 201a-201d. As shown in FIG. 2, a continuous land layer 230 can be present between the base of the grooves 220 and the opposing surface 211 of microstructured film article 200. In one case, grooves 220 can extend all the way through the microstructured film article 200. In one case, microstructured film article 200 can include a base substrate layer 260 which can be integrally formed with, or separately added to microstructured film article 200. 18: FIG. 3 shows an LCF 300 wherein grooves 201a-201d of FIG. 2 have been rendered light-absorbing by being filled with a light absorbing material 350. Light absorbing material 350 in the shape of the recess of the (e.g. groove) microstructure is herein referred to as absorptive region 140. 19: FIG. 4 shows an LCF 400 that further includes an optional cover film 470 that can be the same, or different than, base substrate layer 260. Optional cover film 470 can be bonded to the microstructured surface with an adhesive 410. Adhesive 410 can be any optically clear adhesive, such as a UV-curable acrylate adhesive, a transfer adhesive, and the like. LCF 400 also includes light input surface 110 and light output surface 120 opposite light input surface 110, defining a plane. It is to be understood that for the purposes of describing the invention herein, LCF 400 is positioned such that light input surface 110 is disposed proximate to a base 145 of absorptive region 140, however, light input surface 110 can also be disposed opposite base 145. In other words, LCF 400 can be positioned such that base 145 is closer to a light source (not shown) that injects light into light input surface 110, or it can also be positioned such that base 145 is closer to a display plane (not shown) that receives light from light output surface 120. 20: As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, transmissive regions 130 between absorptive regions 140 have an included wall angle θT ,a transmissive region base width \"W\", an effective height \"H\", a pitch \"P\", and a polar viewing cutoff angle ΦP. Included wall angle θT is two times the interface angle θI shown in FIG. 1 for symmetric absorptive regions. In one case, interface angle θI can be different for each interface 150, and included wall angle θT is equal to the sum of the interface angles θI on each side of absorptive region 140, for an unsymmetrical absorptive region. Polar viewing cutoff angle ΦP can be determined by applying Snell's law to the rays defining the internal viewing cutoff angle ΦI, using the indices of refraction of optional cover film 470, adhesive 410, transmissive regions 130, base substrate layer 260, and the material that LCF 400 is immersed in (typically air). Polar viewing cutoff angle ΦP is equal to the sum of a polar viewing cutoff half angle Φ1 and a polar viewing cutoff half angle Φ2 each of which are measured from the normal to light input surface 110. In some cases, polar viewing cutoff angle ΦP can be symmetric, and polar viewing cutoff half angle Φ1 is equal to polar viewing cutoff half angle Φ2. In some cases, polar viewing cutoff angle ΦP can be asymmetric, and polar viewing cutoff half angle Φ1 is not equal to polar viewing cutoff half angle Φ2. For the purposes of this disclosure, an angle \"Φ\" shown in FIG. 4 and measured from the normal to light input surface 110 along the direction shown, is herein referred to as a \"polar viewing angle\". The polar viewing angle Φ can range from 0° (i.e. normal to light input surface 110) to 90° (i.e. parallel to light input surface 110). 21: The material properties of transmissive regions 130, included wall angle θT, pitch \"P\", and transmissive region base width \"W\" can impact light transmission through LCF 400. LCFs can have relatively large included wall angles, such as greater than 10 degrees or more. Larger wall angles increase the width of the light absorbing regions, thereby decreasing transmission at normal incidence. Smaller wall angles are preferred, such as less than 10 degrees, so that the transmission of light at normal incidence can be made as large as possible. 22: In one aspect, the present invention can be directed to LCFs where the included wall angle can be not greater than 6°. In one aspect, the included wall angle can be not greater than 5°, such as less than 5°, 4°, 3°, 2°, 1°or 0.1°. As described herein, the included wall angle can be related to the interface angle for symmetric and asymmetric absorptive regions. As such, in one aspect, the interface angle can be 3°, or not greater than 3°, for example not greater than 2.5°, 2°, 1°, or 0.1°. Smaller wall angles can form grooves having a relatively high aspect ratio (H/W) at a smaller pitch \"P\", and can provide a sharper image cutoff at lower viewing angles. In some cases, the transmissive regions have an average height, \"H\", and an average width at its widest portion, \"W\", and H/W is at least 1.75. In some cases, H/W is at least 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 or greater. 23: LCFs can be made to have any desired polar viewing cutoff angle. In one aspect, the polar viewing cutoff angle ranges from 40° to 90° or even higher. The polar viewing cutoff angle ΦP, can be determined as discussed elsewhere by the parameters \"θI\", \"H\", \"W\", \"P\", and the indices of the LCF materials. In some cases, it can also be useful to define a \"functional polar viewing angle\" which includes light transmitted through the LCF at angles larger than the polar viewing cutoff angle. For example, light that intercepts the absorptive regions at angles slightly larger than the internal viewing cutoff angle ΦI can \"bleed through\" the thinnest portions of the absorptive region (i.e. partially transmit through the top and bottom of the light absorbing regions represented as trapezoids shown in FIG. 1). The functional polar viewing angle can be defined as the angle at which the brightness decreases to a small percentage, for example 10%, 5% or even less, of the axial brightness. 24: FIG. 5 shows an LCF 500 according to one aspect of the present invention. The light transmission of LCF 500 is greater than the light transmission through prior art LCFs, since some of the light impinging on absorptive regions 140 is reflected by TIR. LCF 500 includes transmissive regions 130 comprising a material having index of refraction N1, and absorptive regions 140 comprising a material having an index of refraction N2 which is not greater than N1. The critical angle, θc (not shown) for the interface is θc= arcsin(N2/N1). Light rays impinging on interface 150 at angles greater than θc, undergo TIR at interface 150. Light rays impinging on interface 150 at angles less than θc are absorbed by absorptive regions 140. 25: FIG. 5 shows three light rays, ABC, DEF and GH which enter transmissive region 130 through light input surface 110. Light ray ABC enters transmissive region 130 within internal viewing cutoff angle ΦI, intercepts absorptive region 140 at angle of incidence θi greater than θc, and undergoes TIR to exit through light output surface 120. In a similar manner, light ray DEF enters transmissive region 130 outside of internal viewing cutoff angle ΦI, intercepts absorptive region 140 at angle of incidence θi greater than θc, and undergoes TIR to exit through light output surface 120. Light ray GH enters transmissive region 130 outside internal viewing cutoff angle ΦI, intercepts absorptive region 140 at angle of incidence θi less than θc, and is absorbed by absorptive region 140. The included wall angle θT, transmissive index N1, and absorptive index N2, are adjustable parameters for control of the transmission of light through light output surface 120. Selection of these parameters can cause some of the light which would otherwise be absorbed by absorptive region 140, to instead be reflected from interface 150 and directed through the output surface within the intended internal viewing cutoff angle ΦI. 26: In one useful LCF, as depicted in FIG. 6A, the transmissive regions 630 are typically integral with a land region \"L\", meaning that there is no interface between the land region and the base portion 631 of the transmissive regions 630. Alternatively, LCF may lack such land region L or an interface may be present between the land region, L, and transmissive regions 630. In this embodiment, the land region is disposed between the alternating transmissive regions 630 and absorptive regions 640 and light input surface 610. 27: Alternatively, in another embodiment, surface 620 may be the light input surface and surface 610 may be the light output surface. In this embodiment, the land region is disposed between the alternating transmissive regions 630 and absorptive regions 640 and light output surface. 28: The transmissive regions 630 can be defined by a width \"WT\". Excluding the land region \"L\", the transmissive regions 630 typically have nominally the same height as the absorptive regions 140. In typical embodiments, the height of the absorptive regions, HA, is at least 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100 microns. In some embodiments, the height is no greater than 200, 190, 180, 170, 160, or 150 microns. In some embodiments, the height is no greater than 140, 130, 120, 110, or 100 microns. The LCF typically comprises a plurality of transmissive regions having nominally the same height and width. In some embodiments, the transmissive regions have a height, \"HT\", a maximum width at its widest portion, \"WT\", and an aspect ratio, HT/WT, of at least 1.75. In some embodiments, HT/WT is at\n",

      "A liquid crystal display comprises a backlight module comprising a reflective polarizing film, a light control film and a liquid crystal panel disposed between the backlight module and the light control film. The light control film comprises a light input surface and a light output surface opposite the light input surface and alternating transmissive and absorptive regions disposed between the light input surface and the light output surface. The absorptive regions have an aspect ratio of at least 30. 1: This invention relates to liquid crystal displays comprising a light control film. 2: Light control films, such as louver films, are often incorporated into automotive liquid crystal displays (LCDs) to minimize reflection. Typically, the light control film is placed behind the liquid crystal (LC) panel next to or laminated directly to the rear polarizing film. 3: Briefly, in one aspect, the present invention provides a liquid crystal display comprising (a) a backlight module comprising a reflective polarizing film; (b) a light control film comprising a light input surface and a light output surface opposite the light input surface, and alternating transmissive and absorptive regions disposed between the light input surface and the light output surface, wherein the absorptive regions have an aspect ratio of at least 30; and (c) a liquid crystal panel disposed between the backlight module and the light control film. 4: In another aspect, A liquid crystal display comprising (a) a backlight module; (b) a light control film comprising a light input surface and a light output surface opposite the light input surface, and alternating transmissive and absorptive regions disposed between the light input surface and the light output surface; (c) a liquid crystal panel disposed between the backlight module and the light control film; and (d) a diffuse layer laminated on the light input surface of the light control film, wherein the diffuse layer has a clarity of less than 70% and a haze of less than 60%. 5: Surprisingly, the LCDs of the invention, which have light control film on the \"front\" (i.e., viewer's side) of the LC panel, provide a significant increase in display brightness compared to LCDs of the prior art, which have light control film behind the LC panel. 6: FIG. 1 is a cross-section view of a LCF. FIG. 2 is a perspective view of a microstructured film article. FIG. 3 is a perspective view of a LCF. FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a LCF. FIG. 5 is a cross-section view of a LCF. FIG. 6A is a cross-section view of a LCF. FIG. 6B depicts the polar cut-off viewing angle of the LCF of FIG. 6A. FIG. 7 is a perspective view of a microstructured film. FIG. 8 is a cross-section view of a LCF further comprising a cover film bonded with an adhesive layer. FIG. 9 is a cross-section view of a LCD of the prior art. FIG. 10 is a cross-section view of a LCD of the invention. FIG. 11 is a cross-section view of a LCD of the invention. FIG. 12 is a cross-section view of a LCD of the invention. FIG. 13 is a plot of luminance versus viewing angle. FIG. 14 is a plot of luminance versus viewing angle. 7: Backlight modules provide illumination for the LCDs. The LCDs of the present invention can comprise any useful backlight module. A typical backlight module may comprise, for example, a light source, back reflector, light guide, diffuser, light collimating film(s) such as prismatic film(s) and a reflective polarizer. 8: The light source can be any useful light source, but in some embodiments the light source is a light emitting diode (LED). A plurality of LEDs can be arranged along an edge of the backlight module to emit light into an edge of the lightguide. The lightguide uses total internal reflection (TIR) to transport or guide light from the edge mounted LEDs across the entire length of the lightguide to the opposite edge of the backlight. A diffuser sheet can be utilized to further disperse the light. Light management films such as a reflective material disposed behind or below the lightguide, and prismatic brightness enhancement films (BEFs) and a reflective polarizing film disposed in front of or above the lightguide can be used to increase on-axis brightness. 9: The back reflector can be a predominately specular, diffuse or combination specular/diffuse reflector. In some embodiments, the back reflector can be a semi-specular reflector. Suitable high reflectivity materials include, for example, Enhanced Specular Reflector (ESR) multilayer polymeric film from 3M Company and white reflective films. 10: Prismatic BEF films, such as those available from 3M Company ensure that the light is directed toward the viewer. 11: The reflective polarizer recycles scattered light to increase efficiency. Any suitable reflective polarizer can be used for the reflective polarizer. For example, multilayer optical film (MOF) reflective polarizers, diffusely reflective polarizing film (DRPF) such as continuous/disperse phase polarizers, wire grid polarizers or cholesteric polarizers. MOF and continuous /disperse phase reflective polarizers rely on the difference in refractive index between at least two materials, usually polymeric materials, to selectively reflect light of one polarization state while transmitting light in an orthogonal polarization state. MOF DBEF reflective polarizers are available from 3M Company. 12: The LC panel typically includes a layer of LC disposed between glass plates. The glass plates can include electrode structures and alignment layers on their inner surfaces for controlling the orientation of the LCs in the LC layer. The electrode structures are commonly arranged to define LC panel pixels. A color filter may also be included with one or more of the plates. The LC structure is positioned between an upper absorbing polarizer and a lower absorbing polarizer. As used herein, references to a \"liquid crystal panel\" or \"LC panel\" include the upper absorbing polarizer and the lower absorbing polarizer (i.e., as used herein, \"liquid crystal panel\" or \"LC panel\" means liquid crystal disposed between glass plates and positioned between two absorbing polarizers). 13: The liquid crystal displays of the invention include a light control film (\"LCF\") on the frontside (i.e., the viewer's side) of the LC panel. The LC panel is disposed between the backlight module and the light control film. Useful LCFs include louver films such as those described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 8,503,122 (Liu et al. ), 8,213,082 (Gaides et al. ), 6,905,219 (Gaides ), 8,133,572 (Gaides et al. ), 8,012,567 (Gaides et al. ), 9,063,284 (Jones et al. ), 9,335,449 (Gaides et al. ) and 9,804,311 (Gaides et al. ) and co-pending publication WO 2019/118685 . 14: LCFs are often made to ensure that the absorptive regions absorb as much of the incident light as possible. Highly absorptive regions minimize the amount of light that may \"leak\" through these regions, and therefore control the directionality and the function of the LCF. 15: The brightness of the display can be increased when incident light undergoes TIR from the interface between the absorptive and transmissive regions. Whether a light ray will undergo TIR or not, can be determined from the incidence angle with the interface, and the difference in refractive index of the materials used in the transmissive and absorptive regions. 16: FIG. 1 shows a cross-sectional view of an LCF 100 that includes a light output surface 120 and a light input surface 110 opposite light output surface 120. LCF 100 includes alternating transmissive regions 130, absorptive regions 140, and an interface 150 between transmissive regions 130 and absorptive regions 140. Transmissive regions 130 have a base width \"W\" disposed apart from each other by a pitch \"P\", and include a land region \"L\" between absorptive regions 140 and light output surface 120. Absorptive regions 140 have a base 145, a height \"H\" and are displaced apart from each other by pitch \"P\". Interface 150 forms an interface angle θI with a normal 160 to light output surface 120. As described herein, by \"normal\" to a surface is meant perpendicular to the surface. LCF 100 includes an internal viewing cutoff angle ΦI defined by the geometry of alternating transmissive regions 130 and absorptive regions 140. 17: FIG. 2 shows a microstructured film article 200 comprising at least one microstructured surface 210, which can be used to make an LCF. In one case, microstructured surface 210 can include a plurality of grooves 201a-201d. As shown in FIG. 2, a continuous land layer 230 can be present between the base of the grooves 220 and the opposing surface 211 of microstructured film article 200. In one case, grooves 220 can extend all the way through the microstructured film article 200. In one case, microstructured film article 200 can include a base substrate layer 260 which can be integrally formed with, or separately added to microstructured film article 200. 18: FIG. 3 shows an LCF 300 wherein grooves 201a-201d of FIG. 2 have been rendered light-absorbing by being filled with a light absorbing material 350. Light absorbing material 350 in the shape of the recess of the (e.g. groove) microstructure is herein referred to as absorptive region 140. 19: FIG. 4 shows an LCF 400 that further includes an optional cover film 470 that can be the same, or different than, base substrate layer 260. Optional cover film 470 can be bonded to the microstructured surface with an adhesive 410. Adhesive 410 can be any optically clear adhesive, such as a UV-curable acrylate adhesive, a transfer adhesive, and the like. LCF 400 also includes light input surface 110 and light output surface 120 opposite light input surface 110, defining a plane. It is to be understood that for the purposes of describing the invention herein, LCF 400 is positioned such that light input surface 110 is disposed proximate to a base 145 of absorptive region 140, however, light input surface 110 can also be disposed opposite base 145. In other words, LCF 400 can be positioned such that base 145 is closer to a light source (not shown) that injects light into light input surface 110, or it can also be positioned such that base 145 is closer to a display plane (not shown) that receives light from light output surface 120. 20: As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, transmissive regions 130 between absorptive regions 140 have an included wall angle θT ,a transmissive region base width \"W\", an effective height \"H\", a pitch \"P\", and a polar viewing cutoff angle ΦP. Included wall angle θT is two times the interface angle θI shown in FIG. 1 for symmetric absorptive regions. In one case, interface angle θI can be different for each interface 150, and included wall angle θT is equal to the sum of the interface angles θI on each side of absorptive region 140, for an unsymmetrical absorptive region. Polar viewing cutoff angle ΦP can be determined by applying Snell's law to the rays defining the internal viewing cutoff angle ΦI, using the indices of refraction of optional cover film 470, adhesive 410, transmissive regions 130, base substrate layer 260, and the material that LCF 400 is immersed in (typically air). Polar viewing cutoff angle ΦP is equal to the sum of a polar viewing cutoff half angle Φ1 and a polar viewing cutoff half angle Φ2 each of which are measured from the normal to light input surface 110. In some cases, polar viewing cutoff angle ΦP can be symmetric, and polar viewing cutoff half angle Φ1 is equal to polar viewing cutoff half angle Φ2. In some cases, polar viewing cutoff angle ΦP can be asymmetric, and polar viewing cutoff half angle Φ1 is not equal to polar viewing cutoff half angle Φ2. For the purposes of this disclosure, an angle \"Φ\" shown in FIG. 4 and measured from the normal to light input surface 110 along the direction shown, is herein referred to as a \"polar viewing angle\". The polar viewing angle Φ can range from 0° (i.e. normal to light input surface 110) to 90° (i.e. parallel to light input surface 110). 21: The material properties of transmissive regions 130, included wall angle θT, pitch \"P\", and transmissive region base width \"W\" can impact light transmission through LCF 400. LCFs can have relatively large included wall angles, such as greater than 10 degrees or more. Larger wall angles increase the width of the light absorbing regions, thereby decreasing transmission at normal incidence. Smaller wall angles are preferred, such as less than 10 degrees, so that the transmission of light at normal incidence can be made as large as possible. 22: In one aspect, the present invention can be directed to LCFs where the included wall angle can be not greater than 6°. In one aspect, the included wall angle can be not greater than 5°, such as less than 5°, 4°, 3°, 2°, 1°or 0.1°. As described herein, the included wall angle can be related to the interface angle for symmetric and asymmetric absorptive regions. As such, in one aspect, the interface angle can be 3°, or not greater than 3°, for example not greater than 2.5°, 2°, 1°, or 0.1°. Smaller wall angles can form grooves having a relatively high aspect ratio (H/W) at a smaller pitch \"P\", and can provide a sharper image cutoff at lower viewing angles. In some cases, the transmissive regions have an average height, \"H\", and an average width at its widest portion, \"W\", and H/W is at least 1.75. In some cases, H/W is at least 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 or greater. 23: LCFs can be made to have any desired polar viewing cutoff angle. In one aspect, the polar viewing cutoff angle ranges from 40° to 90° or even higher. The polar viewing cutoff angle ΦP, can be determined as discussed elsewhere by the parameters \"θI\", \"H\", \"W\", \"P\", and the indices of the LCF materials. In some cases, it can also be useful to define a \"functional polar viewing angle\" which includes light transmitted through the LCF at angles larger than the polar viewing cutoff angle. For example, light that intercepts the absorptive regions at angles slightly larger than the internal viewing cutoff angle ΦI can \"bleed through\" the thinnest portions of the absorptive region (i.e. partially transmit through the top and bottom of the light absorbing regions represented as trapezoids shown in FIG. 1). The functional polar viewing angle can be defined as the angle at which the brightness decreases to a small percentage, for example 10%, 5% or even less, of the axial brightness. 24: FIG. 5 shows an LCF 500 according to one aspect of the present invention. The light transmission of LCF 500 is greater than the light transmission through prior art LCFs, since some of the light impinging on absorptive regions 140 is reflected by TIR. LCF 500 includes transmissive regions 130 comprising a material having index of refraction N1, and absorptive regions 140 comprising a material having an index of refraction N2 which is not greater than N1. The critical angle, θc (not shown) for the interface is θc= arcsin(N2/N1). Light rays impinging on interface 150 at angles greater than θc, undergo TIR at interface 150. Light rays impinging on interface 150 at angles less than θc are absorbed by absorptive regions 140. 25: FIG. 5 shows three light rays, ABC, DEF and GH which enter transmissive region 130 through light input surface 110. Light ray ABC enters transmissive region 130 within internal viewing cutoff angle ΦI, intercepts absorptive region 140 at angle of incidence θi greater than θc, and undergoes TIR to exit through light output surface 120. In a similar manner, light ray DEF enters transmissive region 130 outside of internal viewing cutoff angle ΦI, intercepts absorptive region 140 at angle of incidence θi greater than θc, and undergoes TIR to exit through light output surface 120. Light ray GH enters transmissive region 130 outside internal viewing cutoff angle ΦI, intercepts absorptive region 140 at angle of incidence θi less than θc, and is absorbed by absorptive region 140. The included wall angle θT, transmissive index N1, and absorptive index N2, are adjustable parameters for control of the transmission of light through light output surface 120. Selection of these parameters can cause some of the light which would otherwise be absorbed by absorptive region 140, to instead be reflected from interface 150 and directed through the output surface within the intended internal viewing cutoff angle ΦI. 26: In one useful LCF, as depicted in FIG. 6A, the transmissive regions 630 are typically integral with a land region \"L\", meaning that there is no interface between the land region and the base portion 631 of the transmissive regions 630. Alternatively, LCF may lack such land region L or an interface may be present between the land region, L, and transmissive regions 630. In this embodiment, the land region is disposed between the alternating transmissive regions 630 and absorptive regions 640 and light input surface 610. 27: Alternatively, in another embodiment, surface 620 may be the light input surface and surface 610 may be the light output surface. In this embodiment, the land region is disposed between the alternating transmissive regions 630 and absorptive regions 640 and light output surface. 28: The transmissive regions 630 can be defined by a width \"WT\".

      "In one embodiment, a system includes a catheter, at least one position sensor to provide position signal(s) indicative of a position of a distal end of the catheter over time, a first smoothing filter to provide first filtered position signal(s) responsively to the position signal(s) and a first filtering level, a second smoothing filter to provide second filtered position signal(s) responsively to the position signal(s) and a second filtering level, wherein the second filtering level provides more smoothing than the first filtering level, and processing circuitry to find first and second position coordinates of the distal end responsively to the first and second filtered position signal(s), respectively, generate, and render to a display, an anatomical map of a body part responsively to the second position coordinates, and render a representation of the distal end to the display while showing movement of the distal end responsively to the first position coordinates. 1: The present invention relates to medical systems, and in particular, but not exclusively, to catheter devices. 2: A wide range of medical procedures involve placing probes, such as catheters, within a patient's body. Location sensing systems have been developed for tracking such probes. Magnetic location sensing is one of the methods known in the art. In magnetic location sensing, magnetic field generators are typically placed at known locations external to the patient. A magnetic field sensor within the distal end of the probe generates electrical signals in response to these magnetic fields, which are processed to determine the coordinate locations of the distal end of the probe. These methods and systems are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,391,199 , 6,690,963 , 6,484,118 , 6,239,724 , 6,618,612 and 6,332,089 , in PCT International Publication No. WO 1996/005768 , and in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2002/0065455 and 2003/0120150 and 2004/0068178 . Locations may also be tracked using impedance or current based systems. 3: One medical procedure in which these types of probes or catheters have proved extremely useful is in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation in particular, persist as common and dangerous medical ailments, especially in the aging population. 4: Diagnosis and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias include mapping the electrical properties of heart tissue, especially the endocardium and the heart volume, and selectively ablating cardiac tissue by application of energy. Such ablation can cease or modify the propagation of unwanted electrical signals from one portion of the heart to another. The ablation process destroys the unwanted electrical pathways by formation of non-conducting lesions. Various energy delivery modalities have been disclosed for forming lesions, and include use of microwave, laser, pulsed field, and more commonly, radiofrequency energies to create conduction blocks along the cardiac tissue wall. In a two-step procedure, mapping followed by ablation, electrical activity at points within the heart is typically sensed and measured by advancing a catheter containing one or more electrical sensors into the heart, and acquiring data at a multiplicity of points. These data are then utilized to select the endocardial target areas at which the ablation is to be performed. 5: Electrode catheters have been in common use in medical practice for many years. They are used to stimulate and map electrical activity in the heart and to ablate sites of aberrant electrical activity. In use, the electrode catheter is inserted into a major vein or artery, e.g., femoral vein, and then guided into the chamber of the heart of concern. A typical ablation procedure involves the insertion of a catheter having a one or more electrodes at its distal end into a heart chamber. A reference electrode may be provided, generally taped to the skin of the patient or by means of a second catheter that is positioned in or near the heart. RF (radio frequency) current is applied between the tip electrode(s) of the ablating catheter, and the reference electrode, flowing through the media between the electrodes it, i.e., blood and tissue. The distribution of current depends on the amount of electrode surface in contact with the tissue as compared to blood, which has a higher conductivity than the tissue. Heating of the tissue occurs due to its electrical resistance. The tissue is heated sufficiently to cause cellular destruction in the cardiac tissue resulting in formation of a lesion within the cardiac tissue which is electrically non-conductive. 6: There is

There is therefore a wish to use the space taken up by the silos more effectively. 4: According to the invention, this wish is met when in a silo according to the preamble at least one flexible photovoltaic device is arranged on the roof, wherein the at least one flexible photovoltaic device is fastened to the flexible roof by means of first fastening means which are fixed permanently onto the roof, and second fastening means which are fixed, optionally permanently, onto the at least one flexible photovoltaic device, wherein the first fastening means and the second fastening means are mutually releasable and reconnectable to each other in order to thus fasten the at least one flexible photovoltaic device releasably to the roof. 5: It is noted that the releasable connection makes it possible to remove the photovoltaic devices from the silo or the roof for maintenance. Because such maintenance is essential, it is generally not possible to use permanently attached photovoltaic devices. Owing to the releasable connection, the photovoltaic devices can also be exchanged for different ones, for instance when they are damaged. 6: It is noted that the flexible roof can be a single-layer roof, which is for instance manufactured from a plastic sheet. Such a roof can be manufactured substantially from polyester and can for instance be coated with an optionally synthetic coating, preferably on both sides of the material. Nevertheless, the invention can also be applied to double membrane roofs for for instance silos. Such double membrane roofs also comprise a flexible sheet to which the photovoltaic devices can be fastened. 7: As known in the market, flexible photovoltaic devices, i.e. flexible solar cells, are substantially different from the known rigid panels. Flexible photovoltaic devices are substantially flat, but can for instance be bent and/or rolled up in simple manner without causing damage to the device. In the case of rigid solar panels it is impossible to bend and/or roll the panels. An attempt at bending will result, at most, in a slight movement accompanied by great elastic forces which urge the panel back to its original form. As is known, the panels are very rigid. Flexible panels can conversely be bent without generating such elastic forces, among other reasons because they are very thin (for instance < 1 cm thick). It is therefore very easy for the skilled person to distinguish between a solar panel, which is rigid, and a flexible photovoltaic device which, in contrast to a panel, is flexible, as stated. 8: The fact that the photovoltaic device is flexible ultimately ensures a good co-action with the roof, which is also flexible, because it can be made from a sheet (or can comprise a sheet). Because such a sheet is also flexible, i.e. is deformable such that it can be rolled up, the properties of at least a part of the roof correspond to those of the photovoltaic device. 9: The skilled person knows that flexible roofs are distinguished from other roofs, which are rigid, by the weight of the roofs, among other things. This is because a sheet of a flexible roof is many times lighter than steel or concrete constructions used in rigid roofs. 10: A flexible roof further differs from a normal roof in that the flexible roof can be partially released, rolled aside or folded aside, making the silo accessible for for instance maintenance. Also providing flexible photovoltaic devices will not limit this behaviour. The flexible photovoltaic devices otherwise also have the advantage that they can be mounted on a flexible roof, for instance when this roof consists of or comprises a sheet. Rigid panels cannot be mounted thereon, for example because they require a screw connection. 11: The fastening means can be formed by the two parts of a hook and loop fastening. Such a connection is highly suitable because an extremely good connection to the roof and the photovoltaic device can be obtained owing to its flexible character. A reliable connection can thereby be obtained, which may result in less exposure to weather influences owing to the improved connection. 12: It is noted that the fastening means could be replaced with adhesive, for example. It is possible to apply such a permanent fastening, for instance in combination with features described further below. It is noted that alternative and/or additional measures can then be taken for removing the photovoltaic devices for for instance maintenance. Other fastening techniques are not precluded either. 13: The first fastening means can for instance be welded to the roof. This results in a permanent connection between this results in a permanent connection between the first fastening means, so that photovoltaic devices can be arranged at the correct position in simple manner. 14: An alternative option for attaching the first fastening means to the roof is sewing. Welding and sewing can optionally be combined. 15: The second fastening means can be arranged on the rear side of the at least one photovoltaic device. The rear side, which forms the contact surface with the silo roof, can hereby be used to attach the photovoltaic devices. It is noted that this form of attachment is particularly advantageous when using flexible photovoltaic devices, because known methods, such as clamping of the devices, do not always result in a sufficiently safe attachment. 16: The second fastening means can be arranged by means of an adhesive substance, such as a glue or cement. A glue or cement which remains sufficiently flexible to accommodate the flexibility of the roof and the photovoltaic devices is preferably opted for. 17: Both the first and the second fastening means can comprise a plurality of mutually separate parts. In this way a fastening point can be realized at several locations, without this taking up a large surface area of fastening means. The fastening can thus be strengthened without a relatively great increase in the quantity of material needed and/or other additional costs. 18: Each of the first mounting means and the second mounting means can comprise a plurality of strips. A relatively reliable connection can be obtained in elegant manner by means of the strips. 19: In an embodiment of the silo the at least one photovoltaic device is substantially elongate and defines two end zones lying opposite each other, wherein second fastening means are arranged in each end zone. 20: Fastening the elongate devices to both end zones creates a reliable connection for flexible photovoltaic devices which has not yet been used heretofore. The second fastening means arranged in each end zone can particularly be arranged at a mutual distance. 21: In an embodiment of the silo the roof is substantially circular in top view. The roof can for instance be (frusto)conical. 22: The at least one photovoltaic device can in that case extend radially over the roof, preferably between the centre and the edge. A (frusto)conical roof has a relatively small curvature in this direction, whereby the flexible device need likewise bend less. 23: A plurality of photovoltaic devices can alternatively and/or additionally be distributed over the roof at different angular positions. By distributing a plurality of devices over the angular positions a greater angular portion of the roof can be covered without the flexible devices having to span the whole curvature of the roof over the whole angular portion. Less bending of the flexible photovoltaic device is required hereby. 24: The plurality of photovoltaic devices can also be distributed over the roof at different radial positions. In this way a relatively large part of the roof can be covered with photovoltaic devices with a fixed form, particularly a rectangular form. 25: A plurality of photovoltaic devices can particularly be distributed over the roof such that the number of photovoltaic devices per unit area of the roof varies locally. 26: By locally varying the density a relatively large amount of sunlight can be captured with a relatively small area of devices by taking into consideration the direction of incidence of the light. A part of the roof which generally faces toward a direction of incidence of sunlight can particularly be provided with a relatively high density of devices. The surface area of the device(s) could of course also be increased locally in order to achieve the same effect. 27: The at least one photovoltaic device can be electrically connected to a converter by means of a breakable, and reconnectable, coupling. Removing, repositioning and/or replacing and/or exchanging the device is relatively simple by means of such a coupling. 28: It is also possible to connect a plurality of photovoltaic devices to the same converter, for instance the above stated converter, optionally with the above stated coupling. 29: The converter need in this way not be replaced when replacing the flexible devices, for instance when they have incurred damage. This can save considerable replacement costs, but also installation costs. 30: The invention also relates to a cover for forming a roof for a silo, with the features described in respect of the roof of a silo as above, in any suitable combination. 31: The invention will be further elucidated with reference to the figures, in which: Figure 1 shows schematically a silo with a roof in side view; Figures 2A and 2B show different ways of covering the roof of figure 1 with photovoltaic devices, in a top view; Figures 3A-3C show the rear sides of photovoltaic devices with second fastening means thereon; and Figure 4 shows a silo roof with first fastening means thereon. 32: Corresponding elements are designated in different figures with the same reference numeral, but increased by 100 (one hundred). 33: Figure 1 shows a silo 1 with a roof 2. The silo 1 is cylindrical and is for instance used to store manure. Arranged on silo 1 is a flexible roof 2 of a polyester material which is coated on both sides, in this specific case with a synthetic coating. This makes the flexible roof 2 watertight and weather-resistant. Emission through roof 2 is also limited. Roof 2 is conical and is suspended from a support structure in the centre of roof 2, and from the walls of silo 1. 34: Figures 2A and 2B show roofs 102, 202 in top view. The support structure is partially visible in the form of a support 103, 203 in the centre of the roof 102, 202. Arranged on roof 102, 202 are photovoltaic devices 104, 105, 204, 205. A plurality of devices 104, 105, 204, 205 are distributed in the peripheral direction O and lie at different distances in the radial direction R. This results in an inner ring of photovoltaic devices 105, 205 and an outer ring 104, 204. In the case of figure 2A only a part of roof 102 is covered, making the local density of photovoltaic devices higher on the right-hand side in the figure than on the left-hand side. In figure 2B substantially the whole roof 202 is covered with photovoltaic devices 204, 205. 35: Each photovoltaic device 104, 105, 204, 205 has a substantially rectangular form and is flexible. Photovoltaic devices 104, 105, 204, 205 are connected releasably to the roof 102, 202 by means of suitable fastening means, which will be elucidated further below. 36: Figures 3A-3C each show the rear side of a photovoltaic device 304, 404, 504, which can be applied on the roofs 102, 202 of figures 2A and 2B . Each device 304, 404, 504 is provided with second fastening means 306, 406, 506. The second fastening means of figure 3A are formed by two strips 306 which are arranged at the longitudinal ends of the photovoltaic device. In figure 3B use is made of a plurality of separate strips 406 close to each longitudinal end. Finally, figure 3C shows a number of different positions and shapes which are also applicable for the second fastening means 507. In these examples the second fastening means 306, 406, 506 are arranged on the rear side of photovoltaic devices 304, 404, 504 with an adhesive. 37: Although not necessarily, the second fastening means are in this case formed by one part of a hook and loop fastening. The first fastening means form the corresponding part. 38: First fastening means can of course be arranged on roof 2, 102, 202 with shapes and/or positions corresponding to those of the second fastening means 306, 406, 506. 39: Figure 4 once again shows a top view of a silo roof 602, this time without photovoltaic devices. This makes visible first fastening means 607, which are in this case arranged all around roof 602 as two separate circular paths. The strips 306 of for instance photovoltaic devices 304 of figure 3A could be arranged thereon. A plurality of circular paths can of course be provided. Irrespective of the number or shape of the first fastening means 607, they can be welded fixedly to roof 602 just as they are in the shown example, whereby they are thus connected permanently to the roof. 40: It is noted that, although the invention is described above on the basis of specific examples and/or embodiments, the invention is not limited thereto. On the contrary, the invention is also defined by the appended claims.\n",

Main application scenarios of the 5G are: Enhance Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), and Massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC). 24: The eMBB still aims at enabling users to obtain multimedia contents, services and data, and the demands thereof are growing very rapidly. On the other hand, the eMBB may be deployed in different scenarios, e.g., an indoor scenario, an urban district, a rural area, etc., with widely varying capabilities and requirements, which cannot be generalized, but shall be analyzed in detail in combination with specific deployment scenarios. Typical applications of the URLLC include: industrial automation, power automation, telemedicine operation (surgery), traffic safety guarantee, etc. Typical characteristics of the mMTC include: a high connection density, a small data volume, a latency-insensitive service, a low cost and a long service life of modules, etc. 25: An NR system may also be deployed independently. In order to reduce air interface signaling, quickly resume a wireless connection and quickly resume a data service, a new Radio Resource Control (RRC) state, i.e., an RRC-Inactive state, is defined. In an RRC_Idle state, mobility is a terminal device-based cell reselection, paging is initiated by a Core Network (CN), and a paging area is configured by the CN. There is neither terminal device context nor RRC connection on the network device side. In an RRC_Inactive state, mobility is a terminal device-based cell reselection, there is a connection between a CN and an NR, there is a terminal device context on a certain network device, paging is triggered by a Radio Access Network (RAN), an RAN-based paging area is managed by the RAN, and the location of the terminal device that can be known by the network device is on a level of the RAN-based paging area. In an RRC-Connected state, there is an RRC connection, there is a terminal device context between the network device and the terminal device, and the location of the terminal device known by the network device is on a level of specific cell; and mobility is the mobility controlled by the network device, and unicast data may be transmitted between the network device and the terminal device. 26: In the NR system, the maximum channel bandwidth (wideband carrier) may be 400MHz, which is much larger than the maximum bandwidth of 20MHz in an LTE system. If a terminal device keeps working on a wideband carrier, a lot of power will be consumed. Therefore, it is suggested that the RF bandwidth of the terminal device be adjustable according to an actual throughput of the terminal device. In order to optimize the power consumption of the terminal device, a BandWidth Part (BWP) is introduced, as shown in the schematic diagram of bandwidth allocation in FIG. 1-1 . If the rate requirement of the terminal device is very low, a small bandwidth may be configured for the terminal device, such as BWP1 shown in FIG. 1-2 ; if the rate requirement of the terminal device is very high, a slightly larger bandwidth may be configured for the terminal device, such as BWP2 shown in FIG. 1-2 ; and if the terminal device supports a high rate or if the terminal device works in a Carrier Aggregation (CA) mode, multiple BWPs may be configured for the terminal device, as shown in the schematic diagram of bandwidth allocation in FIG. 1-3 . The terminal device in the RRC-Idle state or the RRC-Inactive state resides on an initial BWP, which is visible to the terminal device in the RRC-Idle state or the RRC-Inactive state. In the initial BWP, a Master Information Block (MIB), Remaining Minimum System Information (RMSI), Other System Information (OSI), paging and other information may be acquired. 27: Since the MBMS in 3GPP Release 6 (Rel-6) has a relatively low spectrum efficiency, which is not sufficient to effectively carry and support the operation of mobile TV type services, in the LTE system, 3GPP explicitly proposes to enhance the support capability for a downlink high-speed multimedia broadcast multicast service, and determines the design requirements of a physical layer and an air interface. 28: Enhanced MBMS (eMBMS) is introduced into an LTE network in 3GPP Release 9 (Rel-9), and eMBMS puts forward a concept of Single Frequency Network (SFN), i.e., using a unified frequency to send data in all cells at the same time, but synchronization of information among the cells need to be ensured. In this way, the overall signal-to-noise ratio distribution of the cell may be greatly improved, and the spectrum efficiency may be greatly improved. 29: In LTE/LTE-A, MBMS only has a broadcast carrying mode, but does not have a multicast carrying mode; and the reception of an MBMS service is applicable to the terminal device in the RRC-Idle state and the RRC-Connected state. In 3GPP Release 13 (Rel-13), a concept of Single Cell Point to Multipoint (SC-PTM) is introduced; and new logic channels, i.e., a Single Cell Multicast Control Channel (SC-MCCH) and a Single Cell Multicast Transport Channel (SC-MTCH), are introduced. As shown in FIG. 2 , SC-MCCH and SC-MTCH may be mapped to a downlink shared transmission channel, such as PDSCH. SC-MCCH and SC-MTCH do not support a Hybrid Automatic Repeat ReQuest (HARQ) operation. 30: In Rel-13, a new SIB type, SIB20, is further introduced. SIB20 is used for transmitting configuration information of SC-MCCH, and there is only one SC-MCCH for one cell. The configuration information of SC-MCCH includes: a modification period and a repetition period of SC-MCCH, configuration information of a radio frame and configuration information of a sub-frame. 31: The configuration information of SC-PTM includes: Temporary Mobile Group Identity (TMGI). Optionally, the configuration information of SC-PTM may also include: a session ID, a Group RNTI (G-RNTI), SC-PTM Discontinuous Reception (DRX) configuration information, and SC-PTM service information of a neighbor cell. 32: In the related art, a terminal device does not expect that two PDSCHs scheduled by a network device overlap in a time domain, that is, the network device only schedules one PDSCH for the terminal device at one time. However, the applicant has found that after the introduction of an MBMS service, the terminal device may work under a unicast service and a multicast broadcast service at the same time. In such a scenario, there is no effective solution on how to perform data transmission in order to improve the efficiency of data transmission. 33: Based on the above problem, an embodiment of the present application provides a method for data transmission. The method for data transmission according to an embodiment of the present application may be applied to various communication systems, such as a global system of mobile communication (GSM), a code division multiple access (CDMA) system, a wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) system, a general packet radio service (GPRS), a long term evolution (LTE) system, an LTE frequency division duplex (FDD) system, an LTE time division duplex (TDD) system, an advanced long term evolution (LTE-A) system, a new radio (NR) system, an evolution system of the NR system, an LTE-based access to unlicensed spectrum (LTE-U) system, an NR-based access to unlicensed spectrum (NR-U) system, a universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS), a worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) communication system, wireless local area networks (WLAN), wireless fidelity (WiFi), a next generation communication system, or another communication system, etc. 34: Generally speaking, the traditional communication system supports a limited quantity of connections, and is also easy to implement. However, with the development of communication technology, the mobile communication system will not only support traditional communication, but also support, for example, device to device (D2D) communication, machine to machine (M2M) communication, the machine type communication (MTC), vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication, etc., and the embodiments of the present application may also be applied to these communication systems. 35: System architectures and service scenarios described in the embodiments of the present application are intended to illustrate the technical solutions of the embodiments of the present application more clearly, and do not constitute a limitation to the technical solutions provided by the embodiments of the present application. Those of ordinary skills in the art may know that with evolvement of network architectures and emergence of new service scenarios, the technical solutions provided by the embodiments of the present application are also applicable to similar technical problems. 36: The network device involved in an embodiment of the present application may be an ordinary base station (such as a NodeB, or an eNB, or a gNB), a new radio controller (NR controller), a centralized unit, a new radio base station, a radio remote module, a micro base station, a relay, a distributed unit, a transmission reception point (TRP), a transmission point (TP), or any other device. An embodiment of the present application does not limit the specific technology and the specific device form adopted by the network device. For convenience of description, in all embodiments of the present application, the above-mentioned apparatuses for providing wireless communication functions for a terminal device are collectively referred to as a network device. 37: In an embodiment of the present application, a terminal device may be any terminal, for example, the terminal device may be a user device for machine type communication. That is, the terminal device may also be referred to as User Equipment (UE), a mobile station (MS), a mobile terminal, a terminal, etc., which may communicate with one or more core networks via a radio access network (RAN). For example, the terminal device may be a mobile phone (or \"cellular\" phone), a computer with a mobile terminal, etc. For example, terminal devices may also be portable, pocket-size, handheld, computer-built or vehicle-mounted mobile apparatuses that exchange speech and/or data with wireless access networks. No specific limitations are made in the embodiments of the present application. 38: Optionally, the network device and the terminal device may be deployed on land, including indoors or outdoors, hand-held or vehicle-mounted; or may be deployed on a water surface; or\n",

      "An inventory system configured for detecting and counting potentially retained surgical items within a body of a patient includes a tag configured to transmit a return signal including an electrical characteristic when energized, a signal generator configured to generate an energizing signal for the tag, an antenna operably coupled to the signal generator and configured to receive at least the return signal transmitted by the tag, a processor, and a memory. The memory includes instructions stored thereon, which, when executed by the processor, cause the inventory system to energize the tag by the energizing signal, receive the return signal from the tag by the antenna, and determine a presence of the beacon tag based on the electrical characteristic. 1: The present disclosure relates generally to interrogation and detection systems for radio-frequency (RF) tags, and more particularly, detection and inventory systems for potentially retained surgical items within surgical sites. 2: It is often useful to determine whether objects associated with a surgery are present in a patient's body before completion of the surgery. Such objects may take a variety of forms. For example, the objects may take the form of instruments, for instance, scalpels, scissors, forceps, hemostats, and/or clamps. Also, for example, the objects may take the form of related accessories and/or disposable objects, for instance, surgical sponges, gauzes, and/or pads. Failure to locate an object before closing the patient may require additional surgery, and in some instances, may have unintended medical consequences. 3: Accordingly, there is a need for a technology that is capable of providing both presence detection and tagged surgical item/implement identification functionality in the medical setting, as well as inventory controls of the tagged items/implements. Specifically, detecting the presence of, identifying, and maintaining inventory of tagged surgical items and materials that are used during the execution of a medical procedure. Technologies exist that enable these functions both individually as well as in conjunction with each other, but the methods and packaging of the discrete solutions used are not ideal for the application. More specifically, the components attached or affixed to the items being tracked are either too large physically and present nuisances or obstacles in the execution of the procedure, or the detection and identification performance of the solution may degrade rapidly in the presence of variable and uncontrolled dielectric or conductive materials. 4: Accordingly, there are needs for improvements in presence detection, tagged item identification, and inventory functionality in the medical setting. 5: This disclosure relates to systems for detection of surgical items and/or devices used in body cavities during surgery, specifically systems that include an antenna to be inserted directly into a surgical site to detect such surgical items and/or devices. 6: In accordance with aspects of the disclosure, an inventory system configured to detect and count potentially retained surgical items within a body of a patient includes a beacon tag configured to transmit a first return signal when energized, a signal generator configured to generate an energizing signal for the beacon tag, an antenna operably coupled to the signal generator, a processor, and a memory. The first return signal includes an electrical characteristic. The antenna is configured to receive the first return signal transmitted by the beacon tag. The memory includes instructions stored thereon, which when executed by the processor cause the system to energize the beacon tag by the energizing signal, receive the first return signal from the beacon tag by the antenna, and determine a presence of the beacon tag based on the electrical characteristic. 7: In an aspect of the present disclosure, the electrical characteristic may be a resonant frequency of the beacon tag. 8: In another aspect of the present disclosure, the electrical characteristic may be a ring-down decay rate of the beacon tag. 9: In yet another aspect of the present disclosure, the system may include an RFID tag configured to transmit a second return signal including the electrical characteristic when energized. 10: In a further aspect of the present disclosure, the instructions, when executed by the processor, may further cause the system to store a value of the electrical characteristic of the first return signal in the memory of the RFID tag. 11: In yet a further aspect of the present disclosure, the RFID tag may include a unique identifier, and the instructions, when executed by the processor, may further cause the system to associate the value of the electrical characteristic with the unique identifier. 12: In an aspect of the present disclosure, the instructions, when executed by the processor, may further cause the system to determine an identity of the potentially retained surgical item based on the association between the value of the electrical characteristic and the unique identifier. 13: In yet another aspect of the present disclosure, the system may further include a display. The instructions, when executed by the processor, may further cause the system to display the determined presence of the beacon tag on the display. 14: In a further aspect of the present disclosure, the instructions, when executed by the processor, may further cause the system to determine a quantity of potentially retained surgical items based on the first return signal. 15: In yet a further aspect of the present disclosure, the RFID tag may include at least one of a high frequency tag, or an ultra-high frequency tag. 16: In accordance with aspects of the disclosure, a computer-implemented method is provided for detecting and counting potentially retained surgical items within a body of a patient. The method includes energizing a beacon tag that is configured to transmit a first return signal, receiving the first return signal from an antenna, the antenna operably coupled to a signal generator, and determining a presence of the beacon tag based on the electrical characteristic. The first return signal includes an electrical characteristic when energized. The antenna is configured to receive the first return signal transmitted by the beacon tag. 17: In another aspect of the present disclosure, the electrical characteristic may be a resonant frequency of the beacon tag. 18: In yet another aspect of the present disclosure, the electrical characteristic may be a ring-down decay rate of the beacon tag. 19: In a further aspect of the present disclosure, the method may further include displaying the determined presence of the beacon tag on a display. 20: In yet a further aspect of the present disclosure, the method may further include transmitting a second return signal, by an RFID tag, the second return signal including the electrical characteristic when energized. 21: In a further aspect of the present disclosure, the method may further include storing a value of the electrical characteristic of the first return signal in the memory of the RFID tag. 22: In an aspect of the present disclosure, the RFID tag may include a unique identifier, and the method may further include associating the value of the electrical characteristic with the unique identifier. 23: In yet another aspect of the present disclosure, the method may further include displaying an identity of the potentially retained surgical item on a display based on the association between the value of the electrical characteristic and the unique identifier. 24: In another aspect of the present disclosure, the method may further include determining a quantity of potentially retained surgical items based on the first return signal. 25: In accordance with aspects of the disclosure, a non-transitory computer-readable medium is provided. The non-transitory computer-readable medium stores instructions which, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform a method for detecting and counting potentially retained surgical items within a body of a patient. The method includes energizing a beacon tag, the beacon tag configured to transmit a return signal including an electrical characteristic when energized, receiving the return signal from an antenna, the antenna operably coupled to a signal generator, the antenna configured to receive the return signal transmitted by the beacon tag, and determining a presence of the beacon tag based on the electrical characteristic. 26: In the drawings, identical reference numbers identify similar elements or acts. The sizes and relative positions of elements in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale. For example, the shapes of various elements and angles are not drawn to scale, and some of these elements are arbitrarily enlarged and positioned to improve drawing legibility. Further, the particular shapes of the elements as drawn are not intended to convey any information regarding the actual shape of the particular elements and have been solely selected for ease of recognition in the drawings. 27: Various aspects of the presently disclosed inventory systems are described hereinbelow with reference to the drawings. FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram showing a surgical environment illustrating a medical provider using an inventory system for detecting and counting an object within a patient that is tagged with an RFID tag according to one illustrated aspect; FIG. 2 is a schematic illustration of an antenna for detection of surgical implements within a patient's body in active use within a surgical site; FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a controller of the inventory system of FIG. 1 ; FIG. 4A is a side view of a beacon tag of the inventory system of FIG. 1 ; FIG. 4B is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of the beacon tag of FIG. 4A as taken through 4B-4B of FIG. 4A ; FIG. 5 is a flow chart of a computer-controlled method for detecting and counting potentially retained surgical items using the inventory system of FIG. 1 ; FIG. 6 is a graph of resonant frequencies of beacon tags of the inventory system of FIG 1 ; and FIG. 7 is a graph of a ring-down decay of the beacon tag of the inventory system of FIG 1 . 28: In the following description, certain specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of disclosed aspects. However, one skilled in the relevant art will recognize that aspects may be practiced without one or more of these specific details or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures associated with transmitters, receivers, or transceivers have not been shown or described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring descriptions of the aspects. 29: Reference throughout this specification to \"one aspect\" or \"an aspect\" means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the aspect is included in at least one aspect. Thus, the appearances of the phrases \"in one aspect\" or \"in an aspect\" in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same aspect. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more aspects. 30: FIG. 1 depicts a surgical environment \"E\" in which a medical provider 12 operates an inventory system 10 for detection and counting of beacon tags 400 and/or radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags 100 to ascertain the presence or absence of items, implements, or objects 100a (and, potentially, packaged surgical objects 454 one used) in a patient 18. The inventory system 10 may include a signal generator 120 and an antenna 110 coupled to the signal generator 120 by one or more communication paths, for example, coaxial cable 122. In one aspect of the inventory system 10, the antenna 110 may take the form of a hand-held wand 110a. 31: The object 100a may take a variety of forms, for example, instruments, accessories, and/or disposable objects useful in performing surgical procedures. For instance, the object 100a may take the form of scalpels, scissors, forceps, hemostats, and/or clamps. Also, for example, the objects 100a may take the form of surgical sponges, gauze, and/or padding. The object 100a is tagged, carrying, attached, or otherwise coupled to an RFID tag 100. Aspects of the inventory system 10 disclosed herein are particularly suited to operate with one or more RFID tags 100, which are not accurately tuned to a chosen or selected resonant frequency. 32: In use, the medical provider 12 may position the wand 110a proximate the patient 18 in order to detect the presence or absence of the one or more RFID tags 100 and hence an object 100a. The medical provider 12 may, in some aspects, move the wand 110a along and/or across the body of the patient 18. For a detailed description of an exemplary inventory system, reference may be made to commonly owned U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0250819 to Blair et al., entitled \"Apparatus and Method for Detecting Objects Using Tags and Wideband Detection Device,\" filed March 29, 2004 , the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. 33: The inventory system 10 may include a display 140 configured to display images and/or other data. The inventory system 10 may include an imaging device 111 configured to capture an image of an area, the area including at least a portion of a body of the patient 18. 34: As seen in FIG. 1 , inventory system 10, for detection and counting of surgical implements (e.g., object 100a) within a patient's body 18, includes a signal generator 120 to provide an energizing signal for a beacon tag 400 and/or one or more RFID tags 100 affixed to an object 100a. Each RFID tag 100 is configured to transmit a return signal when energized, such that an antenna 110 can detect the return signal and confirm the presence of objects 100a within the body of patient 18. The antenna 110 is operably coupled to the signal generator 120 via a communication cable 122, which may be of variable length to provide greater range of motion to the clinician handling the antenna 110. The signal generator 120 may include a controller 200. 35: In one aspect of inventory system 10, the antenna 110 is an antenna 110 configured to be waved over the surgical site 15, e.g., over the body of patient 18. As seen in FIG. 2 , for example, the antenna 110 may be held over the body of the patient 18 at the height of about four or about five inches while attempting to detect beacon tags 400 and/or RFID tags 100, so that the user may detect and/or confirm the presence of objects 100a (and/or surgical object 454 once used in the surgical procedure) within the body of patient 18. 36: As seen in FIGS. 1 and 2 , the inventory system 10 may further include an RFID-enabled secure package 450 (e.g., RFID-enabled smart packaging and/or RFID enabled secure mutual authentication packaging), which includes an RFID tag 452 affixed thereto. For example, an RFID tag may be secured to a lid or a body of the RFID-enabled secure package 450. The RFID tag 452 is configured to transmit a return signal when energized. Generally, the RFID-enabled secure package 450 will include an as-yet unused surgical object 454 configured to be removed from the RFID-enabled secure package 450. The surgical object 454 includes a beacon tag 400 and/or a retained surgical item RFID tag, e.g., the RFID tag 100, affixed to the surgical object 454. The surgical object 454 may include, for example, any surgical sponge, cotton swab, instrument, tool, and/or device that is unintentionally left in the patient at the completion of a surgery or other procedure. 37: The RFID-enabled secure package 450 includes, but is not limited to, for example, caps and closures and are generally configured to verify the contents of sealed containers to ensure the product is genuine, not part of a recall, within the expiration date, and/or has not been tampered with or diverted. RFID-enabled secure package 450 generally includes a secure package RFID tag 452. 38: In aspects, the retained surgical item RFID tag 100 may be linked to the secure package RFID tag 452 by embedding an encrypted block of data that contains the unique identifier of the RFID tag 100. For example, to enable the use of the retained surgical object 454, the RFID tag 100 may be scanned by the antenna 110 in the inventory system 10. 39: FIG. 3 illustrates that controller 200 includes a processor 220 connected to a computer-readable storage medium or a memory 230. The computer-readable storage medium or memory 230 may be a volatile type of memory, e.g., RAM, or a non-volatile type of memory, e.g., flash media, disk media, etc. In various aspects of the disclosure, the processor 220 may be another type of processor such as, without limitation, a digital signal processor, a microprocessor, an ASIC, a graphics processing unit (GPU), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), or a central processing unit (CPU). In certain aspects of the disclosure, network inference may also be accomplished in systems that have weights implemented as memristors, chemically, or other inference calculations, as opposed to processors. 40: In aspects of the disclosure, the memory 230 can be random access memory, read-only memory, magnetic disk memory, solid-state memory, optical disc memory, and/or another type of memory. In some aspects of the disclosure, the memory 230 can be separate from the controller 200 and can communicate with the processor 220 through communication buses of a circuit board and/or through communication cables such as serial ATA cables or other types of cables. The memory 230 includes computer-readable instructions that are executable by the processor 220 to operate the controller 200. In other aspects of the disclosure, the controller 200 may include a network interface 240 to communicate with other computers or to a server. A storage device 210 may be used for storing data. 41: Referring to FIGS. 4A and 4B , beacon tag 400 generally includes an upper cover 406, a lower cover 408, an inductor 402, and a capacitor 404. The upper cover 406 and the lower cover 408 may both be constructed of a non-conductive material. The upper cover 406 and the lower cover 408 are configured to define a fluid tight cavity within which the inductor 402 and the capacitor 404 are retained. The inductor 402 generally includes a conductive wire 402a wrapped\n",
