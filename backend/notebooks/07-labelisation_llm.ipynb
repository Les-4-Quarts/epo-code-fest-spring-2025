      "Erreur : Pour EP4290848A2, Methods and apparatus are provided for encoding and decoding image data using localized gamut definitions. The localized gamut definitions may be defined based on gamut characteristics of the image data. A gamut transform is applied to the image data wherein color coordinates specified by the image data are mapped to corresponding color coordinates in the localized gamut definition. Use of localized gamut definitions may facilitate image data compression or increased color depth specification of image data. 1: This application claims priority to United States Patent Provisional Application No. 61/394,294, filed 18 October 2010 , hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. 2: This invention relates to image processing, image data compression, image display and image reproduction. Embodiments of the invention provide methods and apparatus which process image data for transmission to and display on a downstream device. 3: Image data (including video data and still image data) can have any one of a wide variety of different formats. Some example image data formats are: RGB, YLU, GIF, TIFF, JPEG/JIF, PNG, BMP, PDF, RAW, FITS, MPEG, MP4, high dynamic range (HDR) formats such as BEF, HDRi, JPEG XR, JPEG HDR, RGBE, ScRGB and many others. Image data formats can have capabilities that differ significantly in areas such as, for example, the range of different colors (i.e. gamut) that can be specified, the range of luminance levels (i.e. dynamic range) that can be specified, the number of discrete colors within the gamut that can be specified, the number of discrete luminance levels that can be specified, and the like. Some image data formats have multiple versions having different capabilities. 4: Colors may be specified in many different color spaces. Some examples include RGB, HSV, CIE LUV, YCbCr, YIQ, xvYCC, HSL, XYZ, CMYK, CIE LAB, IPT, and others. Different image data formats may specify colors in different color spaces. 5: Displays may incorporate any of a wide variety of underlying display technologies. Display technologies range from digital cinema displays to television sets which may comprise: liquid crystal display (LCD) panel displays in which the LCD panel is backlit by various types of backlight systems; light-emitting diode (LED) displays; organic LED displays (OLED displays); plasma displays; cathode ray tube (CRT) displays; laser projectors; digital mirror device (DMD) displays; electroluminescent displays; and the like. Within any of these general technologies a wide variety of different constructions and compositions for light-emitting and/or filtering elements are possible. As a result, different displays may have capabilities that differ significantly in areas such as, for example, the range of different colors (i.e. gamut) that can be displayed, the range in luminance values that can be displayed (i.e. the dynamic range of the display), and the like. 6: A wide gamut display may be capable of reproducing colors which are outside of the gamut that can be displayed on conventional displays. However, the range and number of discrete colors that can be specified by the image data provided to a display may be constrained by several factors, such as, for example, capabilities of the image data format, image data bandwidth, image data compression, and the like. 7: There is a need for methods and apparatus for processing and displaying image data with different gamuts. There is a need for methods and apparatus for processing and displaying image data so as to reproduce on a display different colors with a high degree of precision. There is a particular desire for methods and apparatus that can convey image data in an efficient manner to a display or other downstream device, and that can operate within the constraints of different image data formats, available image data bandwidth, and image data compression. 8: A range of aspects of the invention and example embodiments of the invention are described below and illustrated in the accompanying drawings. 9: The accompanying drawings illustrate non-limiting embodiments of the invention. Figures 1A and 1B are gamut diagrams in CIE u'v' color space. Figures 2A and 2C are flow charts of methods of encoding image data according to example embodiments. Figures 2B and 2D are flow charts of methods of decoding image data according to example embodiments. Figures 3A , 3B and 3C are flow charts of methods of selecting localized gamut definitions according to example embodiments that may be used in the method of Figure 2A . Figure 4 shows an area of a frame of image data divided into subframe blocks. Figure 5 illustrates predefined gamut definitions for use with areas of a frame of image data. Figures 6A and 6B are block diagrams illustrating encoding and decoding apparatus respectively according to example embodiments. 10: Throughout the following description, specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding to persons skilled in the art. However, well known elements may not have been shown or described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the disclosure. Accordingly, the description and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative, rather than a restrictive, sense. 11: Colors can be represented in a three-dimensional or three-component color space. The content gamut can be defined as the range of the color space occupied by a local group of pixels in image data. The gamut of an image data format can be defined as the range of the color space that may be specified by the image data format. An image data format specifying colors in a three-component color space using four bits per component, for example, allows for the specification of up to (2<4>)<3> or 4096 colors or component combinations within the gamut of the image data format. Unless a large sample of image data is being considered (e.g. a long sequence of frames), a local group of pixels in the image data is not likely to require all possible colors that can be specified by the image data format. Moreover, it can be appreciated that certain color component combinations tend to occur in the image data more frequently than other color component combinations. 12: Particular embodiments of the methods and apparatus described herein may be applied where one or more frames or areas of a frame of image data do not use the full gamut that may be specified by the image data format. In such cases, the image data may be encoded using localized gamut definitions. As explained below, use of localized gamut definitions may facilitate image data compression, increased color depth specification of image data, and processing of image data by downstream devices of a video delivery pipeline. 13: Figures 1A and 1B , for example, illustrate cases where the area of the content gamut (range of colors occupied by a local group of pixels in image data), as bounded by a content gamut boundary 22, occupies a fraction of the area of the entire gamut of the image data's respective image data formats. In Figure 1A , the image data can be assumed to be in Rec. 709 format having a gamut bounded by gamut boundary 20. In Figure 1B , the image data can be assumed to be in a wide gamut format (i.e. having a broader gamut than Rec. 709 format) having a gamut bounded by gamut boundary 26. For each of these cases, the image data may be encoded using a localized gamut definition which may be determined based at least in part on content gamut boundary 22. Also plotted on Figures 1A and 1B for reference purposes are spectrum locus 30 (the locus of points representing pure spectral or monochromatic colors) and CIE Standard Illuminant D65 (white point representing average daylight). It is to be understood that Figures 1A and 1B illustrate gamut boundaries in a two-dimensional space for ease of illustration. As noted above, colors can be represented in a three-dimensional or three-component color space. Color information specified in a three-dimensional color space may be transformed to a color space where chromatic information is specified along two axes (such as shown in Figures 1A and 1B ) and luminance information is specified along a third axis (not shown in Figures 1A and 1B ). 14: In the case illustrated by Figure 1A , a localized gamut may be defined having a localized gamut boundary 24 that coincides with content gamut boundary 22. In other embodiments, localized gamut boundary 24 may surround or encompass content gamut boundary 22 and/or be proximate to content gamut boundary 22. The origin of the color space occupied by the localized gamut may be defined at some point within the localized gamut. During encoding of the image data, the color coordinates specified in the image data may be mapped to corresponding color coordinates in the localized gamut. Because the localized gamut encompasses a fraction of the area of the gamut of the image data format, a reduced number of bits may be used to represent color coordinates within the localized gamut. Localized gamut definitions may therefore be employed in such cases to reduce the amount of data used to represent the image. 15: Bandwidth limitations for wireless or wired transmission of data may limit the amount of image data that can be transmitted to a display. Accordingly, it may be desirable to apply localized gamut definitions such as described above with reference to Figure 1A so as to reduce the amount of data needed to represent the colors in an image while preserving the original color depth of the image. 16: In other embodiments, localized gamut definitions may be employed to decrease the sizes of the steps between colors (i.e. decrease the quantization levels between colors) that may be specified within regions of the gamut of the image data format, thereby increasing the precision with which colors may be specified. The color depth, or number of colors within a particular gamut that can be represented in an image at one time, is limited by the number of bits used to represent the color of each pixel (i.e. the \"bit depth\"). For example, suppose that the content gamut of the image data to be encoded is bounded by content gamut boundary 22 of Figure 1A , and a 16-bit depth color scheme (using 5 bits to represent 32 levels of red, 6 bits to represent 64 levels of green, and 5 bits to represent 32 levels of blue, for a total of 32 x 64 x 32 or 65,536 different colors) is being used to represent all of the available colors within the Rec. 709 format shown bounded by gamut boundary 20. In some image frames or frame areas, all 65,536 levels of colors that may be specified by such color scheme may not be used; accordingly to decrease the quantization levels between colors a new localized gamut definition may be applied in which all 65,536 levels of colors are redefined to colors within the localized gamut. Use of localized gamut definitions may increase the color depth within the localized gamut (thereby decreasing quantization levels between colors) at the expense of the color depth outside of the localized gamut. For example, if a localized gamut is defined within the Rec. 709 format having a localized gamut boundary 24 that coincides with content gamut boundary 22, then a new 16-bit depth color scheme may be defined to represent all of the available colors within the localized gamut, thus increasing the number of colors that may be specified within the localized gamut to 65,536 (i.e. 32 x 64 x 32). 17: It may be desirable to increase the color depth using localized gamut definitions in certain cases where the display is capable of reproducing colors at a greater color depth than may be specified by the image data format, and/or where finer control of the quantization levels between colors is desired. For example, as illustrated by Figure 1B , if the bit depth is constant between the different image data formats, the precision in color specification of image data in the wide gamut format (having a gamut bounded by gamut boundary 26) will be less than for image data in a less wide gamut format such as Rec. 709 format (having a gamut bounded by gamut boundary 20). The differences between quantization levels for colors in the wider gamut are necessarily larger to allow colors to be specified throughout the increased gamut area. To increase the precision with which colors can be specified, one can provide image data in a higher bit depth but in many cases this may not be practical. 18: In the Figure 1B example, the image data is in a wide gamut format and some colors of the content gamut (defined by gamut boundary 22) are outside of the Rec. 709 gamut. The content gamut of the image data occupies a fraction of the area of the gamut of the wide gamut format shown bounded by gamut boundary 26. To increase the precision with which colors in the image data can be represented, a localized gamut may be defined for the image data having a localized gamut boundary 24 that coincides with or encompasses content gamut boundary 22. A new color scheme may be defined to represent the colors within this localized gamut. The color coordinates specified in the image data may be mapped to corresponding color coordinates in the localized gamut. 19: An example to illustrate how color depth may be increased by using localized gamut definitions is as follows: suppose the full gamut of the image data format is described by N combinations of color component codewords, and the local content gamut is small compared to the full gamut of the image data format (e.g. the local content gamut requires a subset of the N possible combinations). The local content gamut boundary can be determined and the N codewords can be reassigned to occupy a color space up to the local content gamut boundary. The N codewords can therefore be used to specify colors in a smaller region of the full gamut of the image data format, at a higher color resolution (color depth) than previously. 20: The new color scheme used with a localized gamut definition may have the same bit depth as the image data format. In other cases, the new color scheme used with a localized gamut definition may have a decreased bit depth as the image data format while still allowing for specification of colors within the localized gamut at the desired color depth. 21: In some embodiments, a new color scheme for a localized gamut definition may be selected and used by a professional color grader during post-production processing of image data in order to specify colors with greater precision than would be permitted by the image data format's existing color scheme. In other embodiments, a new color scheme for a localized gamut definition may be determined or retrieved by a downstream device and used to enhance the color specification of processed image data which has had gamut compression applied (e.g. processing which compresses wide gamut image data to the constraints of a more conventional gamut, e.g. Rec. 709 gamut). 22: Where image data is encoded using a localized gamut definition, information concerning the localized gamut definition may be communicated to a downstream device to enable the downstream device to decode the image data. Such information may be encoded as metadata in the image data, or it may be communicated as metadata ahead of the frames of image data, such as at the commencement of a movie, broadcast, scene, etc. A downstream device (e.g. set-top box or display processor) may decode the image data for display by extracting the localized gamut information from the image data and applying such information to translate the color coordinate values defined using the localized gamut definition, to color coordinate values for reproduction on a display. The remapped color coordinate values may have the same format and definition as ordinary color coordinate values, so that transmission, display, etc. of the image data is not affected. 23: Prior to display, the decoded image data is optionally filtered by a downstream device to reduce visual artifacts that may appear in the image data after decoding. The visual artifacts may result from the application of different localized gamut definitions between frames or frame areas for encoding the image data. 24: In particular embodiments, localized gamut information may be used at stages in a video delivery pipeline to facilitate specification of color information and operations that depend on local color characteristics. A typical video delivery pipeline includes various stages such as, for example, content capture, post-production editing, encoding, transmission, decoding and display. Localized gamut information that is generated earlier in the pipeline by an upstream device may be passed down the pipeline (e.g. by way of metadata) to guide one or more downstream devices in processing the video data. Downstream devices may use local color characteristics to, for example: enhance details in an image, mask or suppress noise or artifacts, perform local tone mapping, and/or determine local gamut required by a colored backlight in dual modulation displays. The overall computational cost of such operations may be reduced by using localized gamut information which has been pre-computed by an upstream device and provided to the downstream device. 25: Figure 2A illustrates a method 100 of using localized gamut definitions to encode image data according to one embodiment. Method 100 begins by receiving content image data 102, which may comprise one or more frames or areas of a frame of image data. Image data 102 may comprise video data, for example. The content gamut of the image data 102 is characterized at block 104. Block 104 gamut characterization may comprise, for example, determining one or more of the following: a boundary which encompasses all points of a content gamut or a portion of the content gamut; the area within the boundary which encompasses all points of the content gamut or a portion of the content gamut; statistical information about the color coordinates or color information specified for a local group of pixels, such as average values, standard deviation, variance, maximum and n'a pas été trouvé.\n"
