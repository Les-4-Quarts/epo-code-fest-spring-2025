After etching the photo-resistive material layer is attacked for example chemical attack with in dry etching solvents (dry etching), which typically involves the bombardment of the layer with ions (typically a plasma of reactive gases such as fluorine-carbonates, oxygen, chlorine, boron trichloride and occasionally adding hydrogen, argon, helium and other gases). This attack, in addition to \"cleaning\" the photosensitive material begins to \"clean\" (empty) the material of the lower layer, transferring to the low refractive index layer 4 (\"Index of Refraction 2\" in  Figure 19 ) the same curve that was initially formed in the photo-resistive material.

For example, the pumping mechanism may be of the \"four finger\" type and includes an upstream occluding finger 72, a primary pumping finger 74, a downstream occluding finger 76, and a secondary pumping finger 78. The \"four finger\" pumping mechanism and mechanisms used in other linear peristaltic pumps operate by sequentially pressing on a segment of the fluid conduit by means of the cam-following pumping fingers and valve fingers 72, 74, 76, and 78. The pressure is applied in sequential locations of the conduit, beginning at the upstream end of the pumping mechanism and working toward the downstream end. At least one finger is always pressing hard enough to occlude the conduit. As a practical matter, one finger does not retract from occluding the tubing until the next one in sequence has already occluded the tubing; thus, at no time is there a direct fluid path from the fluid supply to the patient. The operation of peristaltic pumps including four finger pumps is well known to those skilled in the art and no further operational details are provided here.", "sdg": "None"}

The method is performed at a destination interface device, 506, and comprises splitting, 202, an incoming traffic into a third path carrying a native ethernet traffic encapsulated in an IP, internet protocol, packets and a fourth path carrying an IP traffic. The destination interface device, 506, receives the traffic over the 3GPP wireless network, 520, which, as previously described, in a preferred embodiment may be a 4G or 5G network. The packets of the traffic are addressed with IP address of the 3GPP wireless network interface of the destination interface device, 506. In the examples illustrated in  figures 5, 6  and  7  this IP address is 10.10.10.2. The received packets are further addressed with port numbers that allows for distinguishing traffic for different robots, 508 - 512, connected to the destination interface device, 506, as well as traffic that contains encapsulated ethernet frames. The part of the received traffic that carries encapsulated ethernet frames use port numbers assigned to a decapsulation function. Additionally, for some types of encapsulation the headers of traffic carrying encapsulated ethernet frames comprise encapsulation ID (e.g. VNI in the case of VxLAN encapsulation). If the VxLAN encapsulation is used, the encapsulated native ethernet traffic is defined by the VxLAN identifier (VNI) and the IP address and port of the VxLAN. In this case the traffic splitter behaves like a router. The packets with IP address and port associated to a VxLAN are routed towards the decapsulation function, while the rest of the IP traffic is sent to the TCP/UDP queueing system. Optionally, the traffic splitter can also check the VxLAN identifier, in case of the setting up of more than one VxLAN, situation typically occurring in correspondence of the PLC side. Therefore, the operation of splitting in one embodiment may forward onto the third path (and to the decapsulation function) the packets with the port number assigned to the decapsulation function or, in an alternative embodiment, the operation of splitting may forward IP packets containing the encapsulation ID (e.g. VNI) to the third path.

{"patent_number": "EP3786218A1", "description_number": 3, "description_text": "In the manufacture of the fiber reinforced composite, a prepreg is often used. The prepreg is an intermediate base material containing a unidirectional material including a reinforcing fiber aligned in one direction or a sheet-like material such as a woven fabric or a non-woven fabric, and a thermosetting resin impregnated into the unidirectional material or the sheet-like material. In general, a fiber reinforced composite manufactured by a prepreg method exhibits excellent mechanical properties because the arrangement of the reinforcing fiber is precisely controlled. Meanwhile, as the application of the carbon fiber has expanded in recent years, various molding methods have been developed in accordance with the application. In addition to the prepreg, methods using a liquid resin, such as a hand lay up method, a filament winding method, a pultrusion method, and a resin transfer molding (RTM) method are attracting attention. Among them, the filament winding method is a method preferably used for manufacturing hollow containers and cylinders. In the conventional method of impregnating a fiber with a liquid resin on the spot and winding the fiber around a mandrel (a wet method), however, there are problems that it is difficult to increase the winding speed because the liquid resin is scattered, and that the impregnated state tends to be uneven and the original strength of the reinforcing fiber may not be exhibited. As a material that can solve the problem, a narrow intermediate base material called a towpreg, a tow prepreg, a yarn prepreg, or a strand prepreg (hereinafter referred to as a towpreg), which includes a reinforcing fiber bundle in which thousands to tens of thousands of filaments are arranged in one direction and a thermosetting resin pre-impregnated into the reinforcing fiber bundle, is attracting attention.", "sdg": "None"}

Corresponding components in the above-described embodiments are shown in parentheses, without being limited thereto.\n(1) A power supply unit (a power supply unit 10) for an aerosol inhaler (an aerosol inhaler 1) that causes an aerosol generated from an aerosol source (an aerosol source 22) heated by a first load (a first load 21) to pass through a flavor source (a flavor source 33) heated by a second load (a second load 31) to add a flavor component of the flavor source to the aerosol, the power supply unit including:\na power supply (a power supply 12) configured to be dischargeable to the first load and the second load; and\na processing device (an MCU 50),\nin which the processing device is configured to control discharging from the power supply to the first load in response to a signal from a first sensor (an intake sensor 15 or an operation unit 14) configured to output the signal indicating an aerosol generation request,\nin which the processing device is configured to control discharging from the power supply to the second load such that a temperature of the flavor source converges to a target temperature based on an output of a second sensor (a temperature detection element T1 or a temperature detection element T3) configured to output information on a temperature of the flavor source, and\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature based on a cumulative number of times (suction times) of discharging to the first load in response to the signal or a cumulative time (a cumulative discharging time) of discharging to the first load in response to the signal.According to (1), since the target temperature of the flavor source is increased based on a parameter (the cumulative times or the cumulative time) indicating consumption of the flavor source, it is possible to stabilize an amount of a flavor component provided to a user for each suction of the aerosol while performing simple control. As a result, a commercial value of the aerosol inhaler can be increased.\n(2) The power supply unit according to (1),\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature in stages based on the cumulative number of times or the cumulative time.\nAccording to (2), frequent changes in the target temperature are prevented by gradually increasing the target temperature. Therefore, it is possible to execute control more stably while performing simple control.\n(3) The power supply unit according to (2),\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature in three or more stages based on the cumulative number of times or the cumulative time.\nAccording to (3), since the target temperature is gradually increased at an appropriate frequency, it is possible to prevent the frequent changes in the target temperature and further stabilize the amount of the flavor component provided to the user.\n(4) The power supply unit according to (2) or (3),\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature in stages in a temperature increment of 5°C or higher and 15°C or lower based on the cumulative times or the cumulative time.\nAccording to (4), since the target temperature is gradually increased at an appropriate value, it is possible to prevent an increase in power consumption and deterioration of the power supply due to the frequent changes in the target temperature.\n(5) The power supply unit according to (2) or (3),\nin which the processing device is configured to acquire a temperature of the flavor source with a predetermined resolution based on an output of the second sensor, and\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature in stages in a temperature increment of five times or more and fifteen times or less of the resolution based on the cumulative number of times or the cumulative time.\nAccording to (5), the target temperature is gradually increased by a value sufficiently larger than the acquisition resolution of the temperature of the flavor source. Therefore, it is unnecessary to devise ways to reduce the resolution, and a manufacturing cost of the aerosol inhaler can be reduced. Further, the frequent changes in the target temperature due to noise larger than the resolution can be prevented.\n(6) The power supply unit according to (1),\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature such that a period during which the highest target temperature is applied is the longest.\nAccording to (6), the period during which the highest target temperature is applied is the longest. Therefore, it is possible to stabilize the amount of the flavor component by preventing the amount of the flavor component provided to the user from decreasing. Further, since the target temperature is prevented from reaching a high temperature due to frequent increases in the target temperature, an increase in power consumption and the flavor source falling into an overheated state can be avoided.\n(7) The power supply unit according to (1),\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature such that a period during which the lowest target temperature is applied is not the shortest.\nAccording to (7), the period during which the lowest target temperature is applied is not the shortest. Therefore, power consumption required for heating the flavor source can be suppressed.\n(8) The power supply unit according to (1),\nin which the lowest target temperature is included in a normal temperature.\nAccording to (8), since the flavor source can also be prevented from being heated at the start of use of the aerosol inhaler, the power consumption required for heating the flavor source can be further suppressed.\n(9) The power supply unit according to (1),\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature based on the cumulative time, to control discharging from the power supply to the first load such that a time for discharging to the first load per aerosol generation request is equal to or smaller than a predetermined time (a first default value tupper), and to apply a width of the cumulative time not less than two times the predetermined time to at least one value of the target temperature.\nAccording to (9), aerosol generation can be performed a plurality of times at one target temperature. Therefore, the frequent changes in the target temperature are prevented. Therefore, it is possible to execute control more stably while performing simple control.\n(10) The power supply unit according to (1),\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature based on the cumulative times, and to apply two or more values of the cumulative number of times to at least one value of the target temperature.\nAccording to (10), the aerosol generation can be performed the plurality of times at one target temperature. Therefore, the frequent changes in the target temperature are prevented. Therefore, it is possible to execute control more stably while performing simple control.\n(11) The power supply unit according to (1),\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature based on the cumulative time and to maintain the target temperature while discharging is performed from the power supply to the first load.\nAccording to (11), the target temperature is maintained during the aerosol generation. Therefore, it is possible to prevent an increase in power discharged to the second load during the aerosol generation. Therefore, sufficient power can be discharged to the first load while avoiding deterioration of the power supply due to discharging of a large current. Further, control can be simplified.\n(12) The power supply unit according to (1),\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature based on the cumulative time and to also increase the target temperature according to the cumulative time while discharging is performed from the power supply to the first load.\nAccording to (12), the target temperature can be changed during the aerosol generation.

{"patent_number": "EP3916976A1", "description_number": 4, "description_text": "With their negligible or non-existent reverse recovery loss, wide-bandgap devices have enabled more common use of the totem-pole configuration in AC-DC converters. In AC-DC converters, as the totem-pole DC output voltage is higher than the peak AC input voltage, the minimum voltage gain is limited to one. In applications where the input voltage is very low, controlled switches S1 and S2 must operate at an excessively high duty-cycle to regulate DC output voltage VO, which increases conduction losses and reduces circuit efficiency. Hence, there is a need for a PFC circuit with an extended voltage gain. Additionally, to operate totem-pole boost converter 100 of  Figure 1  in a bidirectional power-flow mode, diodes D1 and D2 of the half-bridge leg are replaced with controlled switches (i.e., synchronous rectifiers). Furthermore, some applications require a higher gain in the regulated DC output voltage, especially when the PFC circuit operates under a low AC input voltage. One way to achieve the extended voltage gain is illustrated in  Figure 2  by AC-DC boost converter 200, which exemplifies a half-bridge PFC topology. AC-DC boost converter 200 has the advantage that, at any given time, only one of switches S1 and S2 is in the input current path, which further reduces conduction losses. AC-DC boost converter 200 has another advantage in a low input voltage application in which the DC output voltage is at least twice the peak AC input voltage. In that application, AC-DC boost converter has a voltage-doubler characteristic not achievable in the totem-pole PFC topology. However, AC-DC boost converter 200 has a significant drawback in that its output capacitor is much larger than the output capacitor of either the totem-pole PFC circuit of  Figure 1  or a conventional boost PFC converter, as the output capacitors of AC-DC boost converter 200 charge during one half-cycle of the input line voltage and discharge during the other half-cycle. Long periods for charging and discharging require the output capacitors of AC-DC boost converter 200 to store significantly more energy in order to limit the fluctuations around its DC voltage.", "sdg": "SDG12"}

In response to detecting the third input: in accordance with a determination that the third input by the third contact meets enhanced-navigation-gesture criteria, wherein enhanced-navigation-gesture criteria require a movement of the third contact across the touch-sensitive surface that crosses the boundary of the predefined edge region of the touch-sensitive surface (in a first predefined direction (e.g., upward)) and one or more additional conditions in order for the enhanced-navigation-gesture criteria to be met, the device ceases to display the first user interface of the first application and displays the respective other user interface (e.g., a home screen user interface, an application switcher user interface, a user interface of another application, or a control panel user interface), irrespective of whether the first application is determined to be protected. In response to detecting the third input: in accordance with a determination that the third input by the third contact does not meet the enhanced-navigation-gesture criteria and the application is protected, the device maintains display the first user interface of the first application; and in accordance with a determination that the third input by the third contact does not meet the enhanced-navigation-gesture criteria and the application is not protected, the device ceases to display the first user interface of the first application and displaying the respective other user interface (e.g., a home screen user interface, an application switcher user interface, a user interface of another application, or a control panel user interface).

In some embodiments, two consecutive short swipes that are in the bottom edge region of the touch-screen also dismiss the current user interface and display the home screen, irrespective of whether the application is determined to be a protected application or not. In some embodiments, a similar process is used by the device to determine whether or not to display an application switcher in response to a swipe input that starts from an edge of the device and moves onto the device from the edge of the device (e.g., as described in greater detail with reference to method 600) or to switch between different applications or a control panel user interface in response to a swipe input that moves along an edge of the device (e.g., as described in greater detail with reference to method 700 and 800). For example, when an swipe input that corresponds to displaying a respective user interface (e.g., an application switcher, a different application, or a control panel) is detected and the application is protected, if the swipe input meets the enhanced-navigation-gesture criteria, then the respective user interface is displayed, but if the swipe input does not meet the enhanced-navigation-gesture criteria, then the respective user interface is not displayed and, optionally, an affordance is displayed instead. Allowing the user to navigating to a new user interface by providing an enhanced navigation gesture even when the currently displayed application is protected enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interaction more efficient (e.g., by reducing unintended disruptions to the user's usage of the device, and reducing user mistakes when operating the device), which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves the battery life of the device (e.g., by helping the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently).", "sdg": "SDG12"}

In this regard, mid-cruise is the point in an aircraft flight cycle at which 50% of the total stored energy for flight (e.g. fuel, chemical energy storage for batteries, and/or the likes) between top of climb and start of descent has been used (which may be approximated by the midpoint - in terms of time and/or distance- between top of climb and start of descent).

However, most typical automated stores are not designed to appropriately store and sell fresh food or products with a short shelf life or even instant cooked food. Providing fresh products is important to satisfying genuine customer needs. The inventions described herein can provide a temperature-controlled delivery operation cycle. According to one aspect of the invention, a temperature-controlled cart provides an enclosed and protective storage environment for the transportation of items (particularly perishable or temperature-sensitive items) from a point of origin (e.g. a temperature controlled room in a packing or distribution warehouse) to a destination (e.g. an automated store). The cart provides different storage zones that can be separately customised or configured to provide different storage environments (e.g. in terms of different storage temperatures, air flow, physical item protection etc.) to ensure that items within the cart are stored under appropriate conditions to help ensure its freshness (or minimising changes to its state) during the transportation process. Upon arrival at an automated store, temperature-controlled carts are moved into a replenishment zone where item retrieval systems (e.g. AMR) transports containers containing the transported items to appropriate storage shelf locations within the automated store. The storage shelf locations can be separately customised or configured to provide different storage environments (e.g. in terms of different storage temperatures, air flow, physical item protection etc) to ensure that items within the cart are stored under appropriate conditions to help ensure its freshness (or minimising undesirable changes to its storage state). Alternatively, the storage shelf locations can be located in different temperature-controlled zones (or rooms) that provide different appropriate storage environments for such items. In this way, temperature-sensitive or perishable items can be stored in an appropriate or optimum storage environment to ensure freshness (or minimise degradation) of the items prior to sale.

{"patent_number": "EP4192166A1", "description_number": 64, "description_text": "To improve a network speed, a multiple-input multiple-output (multiple-input multiple-output, MIMO) technology is proposed. A basic principle of this technology is to deploy a plurality of antennas at a transmit end and a receive end, so that data can be simultaneously transmitted on a plurality of channels by using the plurality of antennas, and a network speed is improved. For example, as shown in  FIG. 2 , both the network device and the terminal device are provided with a plurality of antennas, for example, both the network device and the terminal device are provided with four antennas. (a) in  FIG. 2  is used as an example. In a downlink direction, the network device simultaneously sends four channels of downlink data by using four antennas. Correspondingly, the terminal device simultaneously receives the four channels of downlink data by using the four antennas. Compared with data transmission efficiency by using one antenna, data transmission efficiency by using four antennas is greatly improved. However, because a capability of the terminal device is limited, in an uplink direction, the terminal device usually supports only single-antenna transmission or dual-antenna transmission. For example, as shown in (b) in  FIG. 2 , the terminal device supports sending uplink data by using a single antenna at a same moment. The terminal device is, for example, a terminal device in a non-standalone (non-standalone, NSA) networking mode. For another example, as shown in (c) in  FIG. 2 , the terminal device supports sending uplink data by using two antennas at a same moment. The terminal device is, for example, a terminal device in a standalone (standalone, SA) networking mode.", "sdg": "SDG12"}

{"patent_number": "EP4425316A2", "description_number": 172, "description_text": "An example formula engine 6302 further pares a redundant aspect of the invalidation graph 6606 and/or a duplicative aspect of the invalidation graph 6606. For example, referencing  Figure 68 , an invalidation graph 6606 consistent with the dependency graph 6604 is depicted. The invalidation graph 6606 is organized with a first value in the first column, and values in a second column within the document 6406 that are no longer valid after the change in the first value. It can be seen that the relationships within the invalidation graph 6606 do not require tracing through the entire dependency graph 6604 in response to a change in a value, and can therefore enable more efficient updating of result values and/or the executable object 6502 than the use of the dependency graph 6604 alone. The organization of the invalidation graph 6606 is non-limiting, and any virtual conceptualization of invalidation checks for the document 6406 are contemplated herein. Referencing  Figure 68 , a pared invalidation graph 6606 removes certain redundant invalidation checks, yet still provides for sufficient invalidation checks according to the dependency graph 6604 of  Figure 67 . For example, a check of data value B in response to a change in data value A is redundant, as data value A affects data value B through the operation of formula A. [should we say somewhere here how this improves the functioning of the computer?] Therefore, a redundant check is eliminated in the pared invalidation graph 6606 depicted in  Figure 68 . Referencing  Figure 69 , yet another pared invalidation graph 6606 is depicted, removing certain duplicative checks still further relative to the pared invalidation graph 6606 of  Figure 68 . For example, although data value A invalidates data value D, that check is duplicative as data value A also invalidates data value B, which also invalidates data value D. Accordingly, the relationship between data value A and data value D is a duplicative check, which can be removed to save processor and recalculation time. It can be seen additionally that the order of calculations can affect the invalidation order and the operations. For example, if data value A is changed, and data value D is changed in response, then data value D will need to be recalculated again after the data value B is updated. Accordingly, the invalidation graph 6606 and recalculation order is selected, in certain embodiments, to reduce the number of invalidation checks and recalculation operations, such as by completing the recalculation of data value B before recalculating data value D. An example unified document surface application circuit 6216 further interprets a user edit value 6602, and formula engine 6302 further updates the executable object 6502 and/or recalculates result values in response to the user edit value 6602 and the pared invalidation graph 6606.", "sdg": "SDG12"}

However, keeping a wireless interface active for extended periods of time may result in the battery or power source of the device being depleted faster than anticipated or desired, making it difficult to use the device for extended periods of time without having to recharge the battery/power source, or without having to replace the battery (in devices featuring replaceable batteries/power sources). Accordingly, activities such as wireless scanning may be offloaded by the smaller wireless communication device to a proxy device having a larger power reserve, e.g., a larger device like a phone, tablet, portable computer, or another small device with greater charge, just to name a few examples. For example, BLUETOOTH™ and/or Wi-Fi scanning may be offloaded from a device with a smaller power reserve/source to a co-located device that has a greater power reserve. For example, a (smart) watch may offload BLUETOOTH™ and/or Wi-Fi scanning to a cellular/mobile phone. Results of the scanning operation may be exchanged as needed or periodically, e.g., over a low power connection between the devices, an example of which is BLUETOOTH™ low-energy (BLE). The wireless communication device with the smaller power reserve (e.g., watch) may then use notifications - received from the device to which the scanning was offloaded - of available proximate devices, networks, etc., which the wireless communication device may then scan for, detect, and connect with. As a result, the scans conducted by the wireless communication device with the larger power reserve may be leveraged to assist the device with the smaller power reserve. For example, instead of scanning at periodic intervals, the smaller (or smaller power reserve) devices may in this manner be enabled to scan when notified that there are devices, networks, etc. in the proximity, conserving energy and scanning for those devices, networks, etc. that are already known to be in the proximity.", "sdg": "SDG12"}

Thus, after sending an RTS signal, legacy STA 620a can wait for a next beacon before retransmitting the RTS signal. In some examples, legacy STA 620a can go to sleep (or a lower power state) and wake up (or return to a higher power state) at, or prior to, the next beacon to retransmit the RTS signal. As shown in example 670, AP 610's radio is in OFF state 680 when legacy STA 620a transmits RTS 662a to AP 610. When legacy STA 620a does not receive a CTS from AP 610, legacy STA 620 waits for a next TBTT/beacon. In conjunction with the next TBBT, AP 610 transitions to full power state 640 and uses data radio 313 to transmit beacon 661. After beacon 661, legacy STA 620a transmits RTS 662b to AP 610 and AP 610 responds with CTS 664 to legacy STA 620a.

More particularly,  Figure 6B  shows an example convergence loop used to determine the actual burn solution described with respect to  Figure 6A . At block 606, functions include determining whether a path-angle error has converged towards zero. Once the path-angle error converges, block 606 progresses to block 608. While the path-angle error has not converged, block 606 repeats. For example, if the path-angle error is found to be above a threshold error rate, then block 606 iterates using updated values for one or more of the path-angle, range target, and velocity target associated with the actual burn solution. At block 608, functions include determining whether a range error has converged towards zero. Once the range error converges, block 608 progresses to block 610. While the range error has not converged, block 608 repeats. At block 610, functions include determining whether a velocity error has converged towards zero. While the velocity error has not converged, block 610 repeats. Once the velocity error converges, block 610 progresses to block 612. Convergence in this context may relate to minimizing the each respective error term to a value less than a threshold value, such as a 1 meter per second error.

For example, the inactive film 5 preferably is an island-shaped film on the gas sensitive portion 3, which is formed in an early stage of a film formation such as gas-phase processing, or a porous film having many (or innumerable) pinholes on the gas sensitive portion 3, which is formed in an stage before further growing into a uniform film. By providing the inactive film 5 at a part of the gas sensitive portion 3, it is possible to suppress the decline of the response characteristic and/or response recovery characteristic of the gas sensitive portion 3 to the hydrogen gas while maintaining the hydrogen selectivity of the MEMS type semiconductor gas detection element 1 within a predetermined range. The cause of this can be considered as follows. As mentioned above, since the inactive film suppresses permeation of the gases other than hydrogen gas, the inactive film might limit an escape of water molecules out of the gas sensitive portion, which may be generated by the chemical reaction that causes the resistance value change of the gas sensitive portion. If the water molecules remain on the surface of the gas sensitive portion or in the inactive film, the adsorption of oxygen molecules, which is required for a reaction causing the resistance value change of the gas sensitive portion, is also limited. In the case of a coil type semiconductor gas detection element, since sufficient heating process can be performed even with a thick inactive film being provided, it is possible to facilitate desorption of the water molecules. However, in the case of a MEMS type semiconductor gas detection element, it is considered that it is difficult to perform sufficient desorption of the water molecules since it is not possible to perform sufficient heat processing for achieving low power consumption for driving. If the water molecules remain on the surface of the gas sensitive portion or in the inactive film, the response characteristic and/or response recovery characteristic to the hydrogen gas may decline. In the MEMS type semiconductor gas detection element 1 of the embodiment, it is considered that since the inactive film 5 is formed at a part of the gas sensitive portion 3, the passage of the water molecules and oxygen molecules can be facilitated at least at a location where the inactive film 5 is not provided, and the limitation of the passage of the water molecules and oxygen molecules can be suppressed as a whole, allowing suppression of the decline of the response characteristic and/or response recovery characteristic to the hydrogen gas.", "sdg": "SDG12"}

{"patent_number": "EP4005506A1", "description_number": 83, "description_text": "Referring to  FIGS. 1 ,  49 , and  51-56 , the shaft assembly 30 couples the end effector 100 to the user control 20. In exemplary form, the shaft assembly includes an elongated shaft 1390 having a pair of longitudinal cut-outs 1392 sized to receive the pair of retention plates 1026 extending from the interior surface 1012 of the right side housing 1002. The retention plates 1026 mount the shaft assembly 30 to the user control 20 and also operate to inhibit proximal-distal repositioning of the shaft assembly independent of the user control. The elongated shaft 1390 is cylindrical in shape and extends in a generally linear direction. An interior of the elongated shaft 1390 is hollow and includes opposing proximal and distal circular openings 1394 at each end. The proximal opening 1394 is sized to allow insertion of a wire alignment guide 1398 (which also has corresponding cut-outs to receive the retention plates 1026) having three dedicated through channels 1406, 1408, and 1410. Each through channel is configured to receive at least two wires and operates to inhibit tangling of adjacent wires. More specifically, the first channel 1406 receives the control wires 1172, 1174 mounted to the first pulley 1120. A second channel 1408 receives the deployment wires 1402, 1404 mounted to the repositionable tab 70, as well as receiving control wire 1364 mounted to the bobbin 1360. Finally, the third channel 1410 receives the control wires 1272, 1274 mounted to the second pulley 1130.
