For example, terrestrial communication is unable to cover areas without communication coverage like sparsely populated areas as well as areas where communication devices cannot be set up, such as oceans, mountains, and deserts. In contrast, for satellite communication, one satellite can cover a large ground and the satellite can orbit the earth. Therefore, in theory, every corner on the earth can be covered for satellite communication. Second, satellite communication has greater social value. Remote mountainous area and poverty-stricken and underdeveloped countries or regions can be covered for satellite communication at a low cost, so that people in these areas can enjoy advanced voice communication and mobile internet technologies, thereby narrowing a digital gap with developed areas and thus promoting development of these areas.

However, even with the rapid-acting insulin analogs, peak insulin levels typically occur within 50 to 70 minutes following the injection. Because the rapid-acting insulin analogs do not adequately mimic the first-phase insulin release, diabetics using insulin therapy continue to have inadequate levels of insulin present at the initiation of a meal and too much insulin present between meals. This lag in insulin delivery can result in hyperglycemia early after meal onset. Furthermore, the excessive insulin between meals may result in an abnormally low level of blood glucose known as hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can result in loss of mental acuity, confusion, increased heart rate, hunger, sweating and faintness. At very low glucose levels, hypoglycemia can result in loss of consciousness, coma and even death.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, in 2020, about 9.9% of the total human population was affected by lack of food security. The occurrence of hunger significantly increased in frequency within only one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Another 17.2% of people experience moderate lack of food security (The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2021; FAO, Ed.; FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO: Rome, 2021; ISBN 978-92-5-134325-8), which means they need to choose between the quality and the quantity of food, owing to which they experience \"hidden hunger\", that is micronutrient deficiency, resulting from inadequate diet in which intake or absorption of the key vitamins and minerals is too low to provide good health condition. Together with vitamin A, iron, and iodine, zinc is one of the micronutrients most frequently mentioned in the context of \"hidden hunger\". Zinc is necessary for the all plants and animals as it is a cofactor for thousands of proteins including enzymes of all the six classes. Zinc finger proteins which have a broad range of molecular and cellular functions including transcription regulation, DNA repair, ubiquitin-dependent proteomic degradation, signal transduction, cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis are most abundant of them ( Maret W. 2013, Advances Nutrition 4, 82-91 ). Moreover, zinc is an essential participant in antioxidative mechanisms due to among others the NADPH-oxidase enzyme inhibition, glutamate-cysteine ligase expression induction; it is also the Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (ZnCuSOD) cofactor ( Marreiro D. i in. 2017, Antioxidants 6, 24 ). Therefore, zinc deficiency results in serious ailments such as growth and developmental retardation, anorexia, and weakening of the immune system ( Prasad A.S. 2009, J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 28, 257-265 ), because zinc is of the fundamental importance in the production, differentiation, and functioning of immune cells, e.g. neutrophils, natural killer cells, macrophages, T and B lymphocytes, as well as in the production of cytokines and in phagocytosis ( Gammoh N.Z. 2019, Nutrition and Immunity 127-158 ;  Prasad A.S. 2008, Mol. Med. 14, 353-357 ). According to estimations, the deficiency of this single element leads to 0.4 million deaths among children under 5 years of age annually ( Black R.E. i in. 2008. Lancet 371, 243-260 ). Antiviral activity of zinc against numerous types of viruses, both by direct antiviral activity and by immune system stimulation was demonstrated ( Read S.A. i in. 2019, Adv. Nutr. 10, 696-710 ;  Wessels I. 2020, Front. Immunol. 11, 1712 ). Hence, in view of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a struggle with zinc deficiency acquires even more significance. Meat (and seafood) is the main source of zinc in the diet of people living in developed countries. However, in areas where the risk of zinc deficiency is highest, diet is primarily based on plant consumption ( Kumssa D.B. i in. 2015. Sci. Rep. 5, 1-11 ;  Lim K.H.C. i in. 2013, Nutrients 5, 3184 ). The main problem of the plant-based diets is related to a highly limited content and/or bioavailability of zinc from grains such as rice, wheat, corn, barley, sorgo, rye, and oats. Tackling the issue of zinc deficiency by the diversification of food consumption, i.e. higher meat and/or seafood consumption, is currently impossible for the majority of the most affected part of population in countries with low or medium income. Moreover, to counteract the adverse effect of the livestock industry on climate changes, the developed countries are expected to reduce meat consumption and follow more plant-based diet. Thus, developing an effective method for the enrichment of edible parts of plants with zinc is so essential. Biofortification, the concept of the basic crop plants enrichment with necessary nutrients aimed at increasing the nutritional value of food is one of the most promising solutions ( Clemens S. 2014, Plant Sci. 225, 52-57 ).", "sdg": "SDG2"}

{"patent_number": "EP4272553A2", "description_number": 8, "description_text": "Weiterhin ist seit langem bekannt, dass Pflanzen, die von elektrischer Hochspannung durchstr\u00f6mt werden, in ihrem Wasserversorgungssystem bis in die Wurzel hinein systemisch gesch\u00e4digt werden k\u00f6nnen. Dabei k\u00f6nnen Samenpflanzen in vielen F\u00e4llen komplett absterben und Wurzelunkr\u00e4uter zumindest so stark gesch\u00e4digt werden, dass sie mittelfristig ausgehungert werden k\u00f6nnen. Seit Verwenden dieser Methode wird nach Wegen gesucht, die angelegten Spannungen bzw. den Energieeinsatz m\u00f6glichst niedrig zu halten. Jedoch wurden hierzu kaum - wie bei chemischen Pflanzenschutzmitteln \u00fcblich - systematische Untersuchungen, insbesondere nicht mit spezifischen wirkungsverst\u00e4rkenden Formulierungen, durchgef\u00fchrt. Die elektrophysikalischen Verfahren konnten sich bisher nicht als Standardmethode zur Pflanzenkontrolle durchsetzen, da einerseits die chemischen Totalherbizide zu preiswert geworden waren und andererseits der gesellschaftliche und weltklimatische Druck f\u00fcr eine umwelt- und klimafreundliche Pflanzenproduktion im Rahmen einer bodenkonservierenden Gesamtbewirtschaftung noch zu gering war. Dar\u00fcber hinaus haben auf der technischen Seite hohe Spannungen und ein verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfig hoher Energieverbrauch auf dem Feld die Herstellung robust arbeitender Ger\u00e4te mit hoher Schlagkraft (Arbeitsbreite x Fahrgeschwindigkeit) und ausreichender Sicherheit verhindert.", "sdg": "None"}

By enlarging the size of the stretching device, the stomach fundus wall 12a surrounding the inflatable stretching device 10 is stretched since the circumference of the inflatable stretching device 10 is increased. By this stretching, the receptors in the stomach wall indicate that the stomach is full, thereby creating a feeling of satiety to the patient. Correspondingly, when the stretching device 10 is contracted, the receptors indicate that the stomach is not full, thereby returning the feeling of hunger. It will be appreciated that this embodiment combines the effects of both reducing the volume of the stomach food cavity and stretching part of the stomach wall, thereby increasing the treatment effect.", "sdg": "SDG3"}

{"patent_number": "EP3915542A1", "description_number": 103, "description_text": "In addition to these applications, it has been noted that the administration of nutrients according to the invention also assuages feelings of hunger. Therefore, the formulations of the invention and methods of the invention are useful in promoting weight loss as the caloric intake required to assuage feelings of hunger is lower than that ordinarily experienced by consuming food conventionally. Thus, in addition to individuals requiring extra calories or metabolic balancers because of exertion and in addition to those unable to feed themselves orally, suitable subjects for the methods of the invention include individuals seeking to control their caloric intake in order to adjust their weight. In view of the generally acknowledged obesity epidemic in the United States in particular, this is an important group of subjects benefitting from the methods of the invention.", "sdg": "SDG3"}
{"patent_number": "EP4438100A2", "description_number": 344, "description_text": "Patients are advised to report a change in satiety (i.e. increased hunger), and/or weight gain as this may be a sign that an additional balloon for therapy might be warranted. If multiple balloons have been placed and the patient reports a change in satiety levels (i.e. reduced early satiety), this may be a sign of balloon deflation. Balloon deflation can be evaluated using radiography (film x-ray, digital x-ray, or fluoroscopy) and gastroscopy as appropriate. Patients are advised to contact their physician if the frequency of adverse events experienced is more than anticipated or becomes intolerable. Concurrent use of Proton Pump Inhibitors can be desirable for the duration of use, e.g., 40 mg/day of pantoprazol or an equivalent dosage of similar medications, in that it is likely an effective treatment for undiagnosed pre-existing esophagitis and gastritis which may enhance tolerability of the devices in residence. Antiemetic and spasmolytic agents can be given immediately following balloon placement and given as needed while the balloon(s) are in the stomach.", "sdg": "SDG3"}
{"patent_number": "EP3828193A1", "description_number": 3, "description_text": "Cataract is a disease of the eye which occurs in the crystalline lens in the eyeball and the crystalline lens turbidity is collectively called cataract. Aging, heredity, metabolic abnormality, trauma, radiation, poisoning and local malnutrition can cause damage to the crystalline lens capsule resulting in increase of permeability and lose of barrier function, or cause metabolic disorders of the crystalline lens resulting in denaturation of crystalline lens protein and formation of turbidity. If the crystalline lens of the eyeball changes from transparence to opacity and has an impact on the sunlight received by eyes, it will affect the eyesight of the eyes. When the degree of turbidity of eyeball is light, the effect on vision is lighter, but as the degree of turbidity gradually deepens, the visual acuity will increase, and severe cases will lead to blindness. Cataract is one of the most common eye diseases leading to blindness and it is a major cause of blindness. Since the mechanism of cataract formation is still unclear, no breakthrough has been made in drug therapy. Therefore, currently the only effective treatment is surgical treatment.", "sdg": "SDG3"}

According to the World Health Organization's report on the global status of non-communicable diseases, type 2 diabetes is now the third most threatening non-communicable disease to human health and life, ranked after cardiovascular diseases and tumors. Diabetes, as an independent risk factor, greatly increases the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases. Prevention and treatment of cardiovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes would significantly lower the risk of adverse cardiovascular events and improve the short- and long-term prognosis. The pathogenesis of diabetic cardiovascular diseases is complicated: hyperglycemia may cause disorders in the internal environment, leading to a hyperinsulinemic state, activating the neuroendocrine stress response system, and in turn incurring a series of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, etc.", "sdg": "SDG3"}
