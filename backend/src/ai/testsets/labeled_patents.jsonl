{"patent_number": "EP4471559A1", "description_number": 251, "description_text": "One example of a multi-finger gesture is a user spreading all fingers apart (e.g., configuring the hand so that no finger touches any other finger). Another example of a multi-finger gesture is a multi-finger swipe (e.g., extending two or more fingers and moving those fingers along a particular path or across a particular real or virtual surface). Another example of a multi-finger gesture is a hand-held approximately flat with fingers all touching adjacent fingers. Another example of a multi-finger gesture is two fingers extended in a peace-sign configuration. Another example of a multi-finger gesture is all fingers extending straight from the palm and then bent at their respective knuckles. Another example of a multi-finger gesture is the thumb touching two or more of the finger's tips in a particular sequence, e.g., first touching the pointer finger then touching the pinky finger. Another example of a multi-finger gesture is fingers held in a particular configuration, e.g., pointer touching middle finger, middle finger not touching ring finger, ring finger touching pinky finger while the whole hand moves along a particular path, e.g., up and down.", "sdg": "None"}

When one or more of these functions is frustrated, a pathological condition results.", "sdg": "None"}

It can comprise a touch screen to allow easy interactions between the parking pay station and the users. Some benefits of the multispace parking pay station 1100 includes\nFlexible: The parking pay station 1100 is available in pay-by-space, pay-and-display and pay-by-plate models. With modular parts (e.g., modules 1101-1104), it's easy to change modes when needed.\nCustomizable: Configurable buttons (e.g., intuitive keypad 1115) include: help screens, multiple-language options, plus or minus time, and more.\nUpgradable: An existing parking pay station, such as, for example, the multispace parking pay station 1000, can be easily upgraded to the multispace parking pay station 1100.\nEnvironmentally friendly: Combines solar-panels with battery back-up for maximum power efficiency. A great choice for Green Initiatives.\nEnvironmentally strong: Highly secure, stainless steel cabinet with graffiti-resistant powder coating and scratch-resistant bonded LCD (e.g., the display 1110) is durable and easy to maintain. The multispace parking pay station 1100 can withstand vandals and extreme weather conditions.\nCustomer-friendly: The operation interface offers users the flexibility to complete transactions in the order they choose. Pay-by-plate automatically populates when users use PARK SMARTER<\u2122> mobile payments or their MY PARKING RECEIPT<\u2122> account.\nMaintenance-friendly: Modularly designed with the technician in mind for easy plug-and-play maintenance.\nSecurity and peace-of-mind: Each unit contains separate maintenance cabinet (e.g., the second module 1102) and collection vault (e.g., the third module 1103 which contains a coin box (not shown)). The cash box is housed in a secure vault that features a six-point locking system and a high-security lock, protected from thieves and nesting insects and animals.\nFuture-proof Design: The open operational interface provides seamless integration with enforcement, permitting, and LPR (license plate recognition).\nAdditional payment options: Upgradable to contactless payment and/or EMV-approved card readers.

The therapist should introduce the participant to the team member administering the SMEODMT, to create a sense of familiarity. Therapist introduces any Assistant Therapist and reviews safety features of the room and the equipment present. Participant has time to ask any questions. The therapist will ask about any responses to the situation and how the participant is feeling about their session. The participant should not be rushed into the dosing by the therapists. The therapist will ask the participant to engage in a period of relaxation prior to dosing. Participant will be asked to lie down, close their eyes, listen to the music, and, if willing, engage in at least one of the breathing exercises with the therapist's guidance. When the participant is settled and comfortable, the therapist will initiate the Session Opening. This practice helps contain and emphasize the specialness of the experience. Therapists will contact the member of the research team to come to the room and administer the SMEODMT. The team member should be aware not to disrupt the peaceful atmosphere of the room. The participant should be in a seated position when insufflating the SMEODMT, as the effects may be felt quickly, the participant should be transitioned to a prone position and remain prone for the duration of the effect of the SMEODMT.", "sdg": "None"}
