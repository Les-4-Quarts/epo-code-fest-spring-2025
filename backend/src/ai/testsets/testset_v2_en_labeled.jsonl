In order to connect a drainage point to the sewer system while making optimal use of the available space and limitations, such pipes are typically assembled on-site using various fittings and connections to provide a pipe assembly which is unique to the house or building being fitted with the pipe assembly. Once assembled, it is important that the pipes are fixedly connected, such that vibrations and/or strain exerted on the piping system do not lead to defects. Today, the most commonly employed method to fixedly connect plastic pipes is still using glue to fix pipes to a pipe coupling. Glue has several disadvantages. For example, it is not environmentally friendly, it does not allow adjustments to be made after the glue has set, it often is applied incorrectly due to lack of knowledge about the pipe material and glue compatibilities, etc.", "sdg": "SDG12"}

{"patent_number": "EP4279132A2", "description_number": 134, "description_text": "Another secondary efficacy assessment will be The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (Sleep-Related Disturbance Short Form 4a) (PROMIS<®>). PROMIS<®> is part of a National Institutes of Health Roadmap initiative. Its stated goal is \"to provide clinicians and researchers access to efficient, precise, valid, and responsive adult- and child-reported measures of health and well-being\" (HealthMeasures 2013). The PROMIS initiative used modern measurement theory and a scientifically rigorous approach for instrument development involving quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods. This approach yielded patient self-report item banks with excellent psychometric properties. The PROMIS-SD (HealthMeasures WWW) patient self-report item bank was developed through an iterative process of literature searches, collecting and sorting items, expert content review, qualitative patient research, and pilot testing. The resulting 27 items assess self-reported perceptions of sleep quality, sleep depth, and restoration associated with sleep. This includes perceived difficulties and concerns with getting to sleep or staying asleep, as well as perceptions of the adequacy of, and satisfaction with, sleep. The PROMIS-SD has demonstrated excellent measurement properties including internal consistency and convergent validity. Validity of the item bank was supported by moderate to high correlations with existing scales and by the ability to distinguish among those with and without sleep disorders (Buysse et al 2010). The PROMIS-SD has been tested and exhibited validity evidence (e.g., expected associations, discrimination among known groups) in a wide range of populations (Busse et al 2013, Cook et al 2012, Fenton et al 2011, Stachler et al 2014). Subsequent research using item analyses and clinical judgement reduced the 27-item scale to 8 items. The authors reported the 8-item version to have \"greater measurement precision than the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)\" (Yu et al 2012). Further item reduction produced a 4-item version (PROMIS-SF SD 4a). The resulting 4 items measure sleep quality, sleep initiation, problems with sleep, and restfulness. Research conducted by Jensen et al (2016) demonstrated the 4-item version to have adequate reliability and validity. Each question has 5 response options ranging in value from 1 to 5. For scoring, the total raw score is found by summing the values of the response to each question. With the total raw score calculated, the applicable score conversion table is used in PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Scoring Manual to translate the total raw score into a T-score for each participant. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Higher score represents greater sleep disturbance.", "sdg": "SDG3"}

{"patent_number": "EP4424612A1", "description_number": 4, "description_text": "One solution for reducing the VOC percentage in dry shampoo is replacing the propellants with a VOC-exempt alternative, e.g., hydrofluorocarbon 152a (HFC-152a). This, however, comes with a huge disadvantage insofar as HFC-152a has enormous Global Warming Potential (GWP) when compared to the usual hydrocarbon propellants. GWP is a well-known parameter that describes the impact of a greenhouse gas on global heating; a higher the GWP, the more a particular gas will contribute to global warming, the lower the GWP number, the more environmentally friendly is the gas. This hydrofluorocarbon option is further complicated by recent regulation on the amount of HFC-152a that can be produced and consumed in the US by The American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act which has been enacted by Congress and looks to reduce the production of HFC-152a by 40% and ultimately by 85%, which means there will be an increase the demand and price of HFC 152a as supply dwindles. An example of an environmentally-friendly solvent is water, which would reduce VOC content, but is typically not considered for use as a solvent for dry shampoo sprays for two major reasons: water does not feel dry on the hair when compared to a volatile solvent like ethanol; and it makes the powders clump and stick together which hinders dispensing as well as performance. Thus, a straightforward substitution of water in a traditional High-VOC aerosol spray formulation is problematic.", "sdg": "SDG13"}

Referring to  Figure 45A , one example of the device 100 can incorporate a plurality of tethers 360 at least loosely coupling the upper portion 112 of the anchoring member 110 to the upstream end 121 of the valve support 120. In one embodiment, the tethers 360 can include a single suture that is run continuously around the circumference 150 of the anchoring member 110. In another embodiment, the device 100 can include several sutures of discreet lengths tied between the anchoring member 110 and the valve support 120. In one embodiment the tethers can be a suture comprising polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Generally, the tethers 360 assist in distributing forces evenly along the anchoring member 110 without deforming the valve support 120 or compromising the closure of the prosthetic valve 130. In some arrangements, the tethers 360 can assist in limiting radial expansion of the upstream portion. Accordingly, even with the incorporation of the tethers 360, the valve support 120 remains mechanically isolated from at least the upstream portion of the anchoring member 110.", "sdg": "SDG3"}

A distance between the anode body portion of odd-numbered pixel column and the storage capacitor is greater, and the orthographic projection of the anode body portion of the odd-numbered pixel column on the base substrate does not overlap the orthographic projection of the first connection electrode 41 on the base substrate, so that for the parasitic capacitance formed by the second node N2 and the fourth node N4, the parasitic capacitance of the even-numbered pixel column is greater than that of the odd-numbered pixel column. It is found in the research that in a light emitting initial stage of a pixel, a potential of the fourth node N4 will increase with the increase of luminance, which thereby will bring a potential of the second node N2 to increase. When the parasitic capacitance of the odd-numbered pixel column is different from the parasitic capacitance of the even-numbered pixel column, the increasing degree of the potential of the second node N2 of the odd-numbered pixel column is different from the increasing degree of the potential of the second node N2 of the even-numbered pixel column, so that the luminance of the light emitting unit of the odd-numbered pixel column is different from the luminance of the light emitting unit of the even-numbered pixel column, resulting in a display defect with vertical stripes.", "sdg": "None"}

After 10 minutes a solution of 5 g citric acid in 21 kg of water was under constant mixing for 10 minutes. 21 kg of water was then added and mixed for 10 minutes. Finally, a solution of 5 g citric acid in 21 kg of water was add and the mixture was mixed for 200 minutes.\nA portion of the material from the mixing bowl was placed with a spoon on a silicone sheet on a stainless steel tray. Using a plastic spatula the material was spread until it appeared uniform without spilling over the edges. This was repeated using additional trays until all of the material was spread on trays.\nThe trays were placed in an oven set to 70° C. When drying was complete (48 hours) the trays were removed from the oven.\nThe sheets of dried material were broken into smaller pieces that could be easily ground. The grinding was started by inserting the material slowly into a collection bin to insure that the material did not overheat on grinding. At the end of the grinding, the material was sieved between 100 and 1600 µm.\nThe ground material was placed in a stainless steel drum. The drum was placed in an oven heated to 120 (±1) °C to induce crosslinking. The drum was removed from the oven after 4 hours. 1 kg of the crosslinked material was placed in a stainless steel tank with 150 kg water with constant stirring at room temperature for 4 hours. The resulting swollen material was filtered using a sieve and the water was removed using a vacuum pump. The ratio of swelling obtained was 73.2 g/g. The washed material was placed on plastic trays. Using a plastic spatula, the material was spread evenly in the trays. The trays were placed in an oven set to 70 (±1) °C. After drying was complete (72 h), the trays were removed from the oven.\nThe dried material was inserted slowly into the collection bin of a grinder to insure that it would not overheat on grinding. The ground material was sieved between 100 and 1000 µm.\nThe media uptake ratio of the resulting powder, determined as set forth in Example 5, was 70.29 g/g.

The inset depicts the arachnoid granulations located along the major venous sinuses, which are the primary locations for CSF reabsorption.\nFigure 2  provides a view of the ventricular system from the A) lateral surface, B) anterior surface, C) superior surface and D) detailed ventricular structure.\nFigure 3  illustrates the ventricular anatomy of the brain in a 3 dimensional perspective.\nFigure 4  depicts the Blood-Brain and Blood-CSF Barriers. A) fenestrated capillary allowing passage of water and solutes, B) brain capillaries with tight junctions between endothelial cells, forming blood-brain barrier; requires cellular transport, C) choroids plexus epithelial cells form the blood-CSF barrier and allow water and solutes but require cellular transport, D) arachnoid villi allow one-way bulk flow of CSF into major venous sinuses.\nFigure 5  illustrates the oligomeric hypothesis of neurodegenerative diseases. The multi-step process is thought to underlie a number of different neurologic conditions. The disease specific proteins undergo a specific biochemical modification which makes them prone to join and form globular intermediates (known as oligomers). These oligomers are thought to be toxic and can continue to build on one another forming protofibrils and fibrils. The fibrils may then be isolated into an intracellular inclusion (e.g. tau tangles) or an extracellular deposit (e.g. Aβ plaque) in the case of Alzheimer's disease.\nFigure 6A  illustrates a schematic of the ventricular, spinal and ventriculo-spinal approaches for accessing the CSF space for the efficient turnover of conditioned CSF.  Figure 6B  illustrates one embodiment of the dual- and single- ventricular approaches of the invention.  Figure 6C  illustrates one embodiment of the spinal approach of the invention.\nFigure 7  illustrates a schematic of a single lumen system. A single-lumen system creates a local eddy (shading) with minimal mixing or access to cranial CSF.\nFigure 8A  illustrates a schematic of a dual lumen system of the invention. A multi-lumen system creates an active and dynamic flow with efficient mixing that is not limited by pressure volume as inflow and outflow are relatively equal. This allows for parallel processing of CSF with maximum turnover and provides access to the cranial and spinal space and entire CSF volume (mixing represented by shading).  Figure 8B  illustrates the dramatic difference in CSF clearance produced with a multilumen system in which inflow and outflow are substantially apart (line D), adjacent (line C) compared to a single lumen system (line B) compared to diffusion-limited flow (line A).  Figure 8C  illustrates the effect of catheter inflow/outflow distance on the rate of reprocessing of conditioned CSF.\nFigure 9A and 9B  illustrates cross-sections of sample dual or multilumen catheters, respectively, for use in the CSF space. These are but two examples of many embodiments that may be envisioned to achieve one of the ultimate goals of the invention which is a method to provide efficient mixing and turnover of CSF.\nFigure 10  illustrates catheters with helical out flow paths which induce additional mixing at various outflow points.  Figure 10A  illustrates a single helical outflow path over last length (1) of catheter. A straight outflow lumen connects to the helical path. The catheter comprises a straight central inflow lumen.  Figure 10B  illustrates a dual helical outflow path catheter with central inflow path.\nFigure 11A  illustrates dual helical outflow paths exiting at different points along the catheter. The catheter comprises a single central inflow path. As described herein, the paths can be reversed, for example, by a pump mechanism. Therefore, a catheter with a single inflow path and multiple outflow paths could become a single outflow path with multiple inflow paths.  Figure 11B  illustrates how helical path directional changes as another means of creating a directed flow.\nFigure 12A  illustrates two catheters bound by a double collar. The collar is fixed to one catheter and slips on other such that the distance \"d\" between the two ends is adjustable. In this case, the inflow catheter is interfaced with the slipping portion of the collar.  Figure 12B  illustrates a dual lumen catheter that is encircled by a tight fitting thin walled cannula. The outflow lumen of the inner catheter has side ports such that, as the cannula is pulled back additional side ports or openings are exposed, thereby increasing the distance between the inflow and outflow.\nFigure 13A  illustrates a dual lumen catheter with addressable holes on one lumen.  Figure 13B  illustrates a two catheter system creating a dual lumen catheter. As shown, the outflow catheter is created by the space between the inner and outer catheters.\nFigure 14A  illustrates a dual lumen catheter with partially overlapping side ports for use in sub arachnoid to ventricular access.

(c) Functional analysis of the 1230 differentially expressed genes observed in IL-15 cultured Cish<-/-> NK cells. Gene ontology was performed using the PANTHER classification system. Major gene networks are shown as a percentage of total differentially expressed genes in Cish<-/-> cells.\nFigure 8- Cish<-/-> NK cells display increased JAK/STAT signalling and normal respiration and glycolysis. (a)Cish<+/+> and Cish<-/-> NK cells were cultured and washed free of IL-15-containing media. Cells were lysed at various times post-wash as indicated. Levels of phosphorylated (p) and total signaling proteins were analysed by Western blotting with specific antibodies. (b)Cish<-/-> NK cell respiration and glycolysis is unperturbed. Cish<+/+> and Cish<-/-> NK cells were cultured in the presence of IL-15 and the extracellular acidification rater (ACR; glycolysis) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR; mitochondrial respiration) measured using the XF Analyzer system. Glucose (1), Oligomycin (2), FCCP and pyruvate (3) and Antimycin A/Rotenone (4) were added at times indicated by the numbered arrows. (c) Overview of the proteomic workflow used in this study. Equal numbers of cultured NK cells derived from Cish<+/+> and Cish<-/-> mice were lysed and subjected to kinase enrichment using NHS-CYT-387 beads. Protein eluates from the CYT-387 resin, in addition to a portion of whole cell lysate (pre-kinase enrichment) were subjected to trypsin digestion and nanoLC-MS/MS.

Kinase inhibition assays were performed with the kinase domain (JH1) of JAK1 in the presence of increasing amounts of human full-length CIS (CIS), CIS lacking the PEST motif (ΔPEST), CIS lacking both the N-terminal region and the PEST motif (ΔNT/ΔPEST), or CIS lacking the N-terminal 34 residues (ΔN34), without (a) or with (b), excess phenyl phosphate (PP) as a competitor. (c) Alternatively, 50 µM JAK1-Y1034 or JAK3-Y980,Y981 phosphopeptides were used as competitor. Data were normalised to no-CIS controls. All CIS constructs contained the SOCS box and were expressed and purified as a trimeric complex consisting of CIS, elongin B and elongin C. Inset: table shows IC50 values for (a).\nFigure 12 - Deletion of the CIS N-terminal region or PEST motif does not have a major impact on binding to phosphopeptide. Isothermal calorimetry (ITC) was used to measure (a) the affinity of human full-length CIS, CIS lacking the PEST motif (ΔPEST), CIS lacking both the N-terminal region and the PEST motif (ΔNT/ΔPEST), or CIS lacking the N-terminal 34 residues (ΔN34) binding to phosphopeptides corresponding to tyrosines within the JAK1 kinase domain activation loop (JAK1-Y1034).

ITC titration curves are shown. The titration curves all fitted well to a single-site model.\nFigure 13- CIS-SH2 domain binds to an extended peptide interface. Isothermal calorimetry (ITC) was used to measure the affinity of CIS lacking both the N-terminal region and the PEST motif (ΔNT/ΔPEST) binding to phosphopeptides corresponding to tyrosines within the JAK1 kinase domain activation loop (JAK1-Y1034). Peptides were either wild-type or contained an alanine substitution at the +5, +3 or -3 position. 300 µM phosphopeptides were titrated into a 30 µM solution of the GST-CIS-SH2-BC ternary complex. ITC titration curves are shown. The titration curves all fitted well to a single-site model.\nFigure 14- CIS inhibition is dose dependent and requires a functional SH2 domain. (a) NK cells were purified from the spleens of Cish<-/->, Cish<+/-> and Cish<+/+> mice, labeled with the cell tracking dye CTV and cultured for 6 days in an increasing concentration of IL-15, prior to flow cytometry analysis. A decrease in total fluoresence (Geo Mean) indicates an increase in proliferation. (b) Equal numbers of NK cells from the spleens of Cish<-/->Cish<+/-> and Cish<+/+> mice were expanded in IL-15 for 10 days. Absolute NK cell numbers post-culture. (c) NK cells were then washed free of cytokine and rested for 4 h prior to treatment with 100 ng/mL IL-15 and 10 µM MG132, as indicated. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies to CIS and actin as a loading control.\nFigure 15- The kinetics of CIS induction are consistent with inhibition of JAK/STAT signalling in human NK cells. Patient-derived human NK cells (a) or NK lymphoma cell lines (b) SNK-10, (c) NKL and NK6, (d) NK-92 were washed free of cytokine and rested for 4 h (a) or 16 h (b-d) prior to treatment with IL-15 for the indicated times. In some instances, cells were incubated with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (10 µM). Cells were lysed and analysed by immunoblotting with antibodies to the indicated phosphorylated (p) and total proteins.\nFigure 16- The kinetics of Cish mRNA induction are consistent with inhibition of JAK/STAT signalling in human NK cells. Human NK lymphoma cell lines KHYG-1 (a-c) and NK-92 (D-F) were washed free of cytokine and rested overnight prior to treatment with IL-15 for the indicated times. Cells were lysed and analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) for Cish, Socs1, Socs3 mRNA expression. Relative expression was determined by normalizing the amount of each gene of interest to the housekeeping gene 18s ribosomal RNA. Each condition had three biological replicates and measurements were performed in duplicate.\nFigure 17- Schematic summarising the ubiquitination (U) and phosphorylation (P) sites identified by mass spectrometry.

Spleens were harvested from Cish<-/-> and Cish<+/+> mice and processed into single cell suspensions. Surface and intracellular staining was performed by flow cytometry to determine: (A) The percentage of Cish<+/+> and Cish<-/-> cells in different NK cell subsets. Total NK cells were identified as being NK1.1+ NKp46+ and were further subdivided into immature NK cells (CD27+ CD11b-; Imm), M1 (CD27+ CD11b+) and M2 (CD27- CD11b+) subsets, with M2 denoting the most mature and cytotoxic NK cell population. (B) The number of DNAM1+ KLRG1+ NK cells. In general, DNAM+ cells show greater production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and heightened response to IL-15, whilst KLRG1 is considered to be an alternative maturation marker (C) The percentage of Ki67+ cells in each NK cell subset (Imm, M1, M2). Ki67 is a marker for cellular proliferation. n=6 mice per group. p<0.05. Collectively, these data show that although the total number of NK cells did not differ between Cish<+/+> and Cish<-/-> mice, Cish<-/-> NK cells were more mature and likely to display increased cytokine production and cytotoxicity, with all Cish<-/-> subsets showing increased cell cycling.\nFigure 25- Enhanced control of MCA1956 sarcoma requires both NK cells and CD8 T cells.

For the enrichment of NK cells PBMC were harvested from overnight cultures and used for one round of negative selection using the EasySep<™> Human NK Cell Enrichment Kit (Stem Cell Technologies, cat.: 17055) for the immunomagnetic isolation of untouched human NK cells and the Big Easy EasySep<™> Magnet (Stem Cell Technologies, cat.: 18001) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ;Preloading of NK cells and freeze/thaw;[0160]    Aliquots of enriched primary human NK cells were resuspended in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 µg/mL of the indicated antibody constructs in a total volume of 0.5 mL and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. As indicated, half of the aliquots was washed twice with 5 mL complete RPMI 1640 medium and then resuspended in 0.5 mL complete RPMI 1640 medium, and the second half of the aliquots was not washed before FCS supplemented with 20% DMSO (Sigma) was added. The cell suspensions were then transferred to 2 mL cryo tubes (Greiner bio-one) and frozen at -80°C in cryo 1°C freezing container (Nalgene) for more than 12 h. ;4 h calcein-release cytotoxicity assays;[0161]    For calcein-release cytotoxicity assays the indicated target cells were harvested from cultures, washed with RPMI 1640 medium without FCS, and labeled with 10 µM calcein AM (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, cat.: C3100MP) for 30 min in RPMI medium without FCS at 37°C. After gently washing the labeled cells were resuspended in complete RPMI 1640 medium to a density of 1×10<5>/mL, and aliquots of 1×10<4> target cells were then seeded in individual wells of a 96-well round-bottom micro plate. In parallel, NK cells were thawed from -80°C by incubation of the cryo tubes in a 37°C water bath. When the last ice crystals were visible, the cell suspension was diluted with complete RPMI 1640 medium centrifuged and washed once before the cells were added to the target cells at the indicated effector-to-target (E:T) ratio with or without addition of fresh antibody as indicated in a total volume of 200 µL in duplicates. Spontaneous release was determined by incubation of target cells in the absence of effector cells and without antibodies, and maximal release was induced by the addition of 1% Triton x-100 (final concentration, Roth) and also measured in quadruplicate on each plate. ;[0162]    After centrifugation for 2 min at 200 g the assay was incubated for 4 h at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. 100 µL cell culture supernatant were harvested from each well after an additional centrifugation for 5 min at 500 g, and the fluorescence of the released calcein was measured at 520 nm using a fluorescence multi-plate reader (Victor 3 or EnSight, Perkin Elmer). On the basis of the measured counts, the specific cell lysis was calculated according to the following formula: [fluorescence (sample) - fluorescence (spontaneous)] / [fluorescence (maximum) - fluorescence (spontaneous)] × 100%. Fluorescence (spontaneous) represents the fluorescent counts from target cells in the absence of effector cells and antibodies and fluorescence (maximum) represents the total cell lysis induced by the addition of Triton X-100. Lysis values were analyzed and mean and standard deviation were plotted using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Prism version 7.04 for Windows, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA). ;[0163]    The results are shown in  figure 1 . ;Example 2: Analysis of binding of anti-CD16 antibodies to different antigen variants;[0164]    FcgRIII (CD16), the low-affinity receptor for the Fc part of IgG exists in two isoforms encoded by two nearly identical genes: FCGR3A (CD16A) and FCGR3B (CD16B), resulting in tissue-specific expression of alternative membrane-anchored isoforms ( Ravetch and Perussia, 1989, J Exp Med. ):\nFcgRIIIA (CD16A) is expressed as a transmembrane protein on NK cells, makrophages, and subsets of monocytes and T-cells\nFcgRIIIB (CD16B) is expressed glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored by neutrophils and after gamma-interferon stimulation by eosinophils.;[0165]    Allelic variants/polymorphisms of both, CD16A and CD16B are well known (summarized in Table 2). ;[0166]    CD16B allotypic variants differ in five amino acids of the extracellular domain (ECD) (Table 2). Two of these enable additional glycosylation, resulting in three different variants of the GPI-anchored FcyRIIIB granulocyte antigens HNA-1a, -1b, and -1c (formerly named NA1, NA2 and SH). ;[0167]    There are only few differences in the amino acid sequences of CD16A and B. Their differences are restricted to two alternative amino acids in the mature ECD (Table 2). Additional differences reside in the disparate modes of membrane anchorage of CD16A and CD16B. The C-terminal propeptide sequence of CD16B which is cleaved off in the mature GPI-anchored form is highly homologous to the sequence connecting CD16A ECD to its transmembrane domain (Table 2).\nTable 2: Summary of sequence variations of FcgRIIIA (CD16A) and FcgRIIIB (CD16B) alleles. We use amino acid numbers displayed in the left column. Corresponding numbering from Uniprot is shown on the right for comparison.

In addition, CD16B ECD mutants in which CD16B-specific amino acids were replaced with the corresponding residues of CD16A were constructed, expressed and tested in binding assays: CD16B<D129G>, CD16B<H140Y>, CD16B<S185F>. All these antigen variants were fused via glycin-serin linker to soluble monomeric Fc ( Ying et al, 2012, J. Biol. Chem. ), expressed in CHO and purified from cell culture supernatants. ;[0171]    A scFv antibody comprising the variable heavy and light chain sequences of the published CD16A- and CD16B-reactive antibody 3G8 recognizes all tested CD16A and CD16B antigen variants ( Figure 2 , Table 3). Different antibodies containing the variable heavy and light chain sequences of \"LSIV21\" or the affinity-improved \"P2C47\" (in form of monovalent scFv or bivalently binding tetravalent bispecific tandem diabody antibodies) recognizes CD16A but not the mature or propeptide-containing ECD fusion antigens of CD16B. If however Histidine (H) at position 140 in the CD16B ECD was mutated to Tyrosine (Y) - the amino acid present at the corresponding position in CD16A - this mutant form of CD16B (CD16B<H140Y>) was well recognized by antibodies containing the \"LSIV21\" or \"P2C47\" variable domains ( Figure 2 , Table 3).\nTable 3: Summary of binding of different anti-CD16 antibodies to coated CD16 antigen variants analyzed in ELISA.

Results show that except for scFv \"CD16-5\" which shows weak cross-reactivity with CD16B, the other affinity matured anti-CD16 scFv antibodies maintain the CD16A selective binding property of the parental antibody. They do not bind to CD16B, unless CD16B contains the previously described amino acid exchange CD16B<H140Y> (Table 4). All anti-CD16 antibodies show very good cross-reactivity with cynomolgus CD16A (Table 4), despite the fact that the cynomolgus CD16A ECD sequence differs in a total of 16 amino acids from human CD16A (see alignment in  Figure 4 ). ;[0173]    The importance of Tyrosine (Y) at position 140 in the CD16 ECD for CD16A-specific recognition by our antibodies was also confirmed using recombinant CHO cells with transgenic expression of different CD16 antigen variants on the cell surface. ECD sequences were either fused to the transmembrane domain of human EGFR ( Wang et al., 2011, Blood 118(5)1255 ) or anchored via GPI using the human CD16B endogenous sequence with the full length propeptide sequence for posttranslational processing and lipidation for GPI-anchorage. ;[0174]    scFv antibody comprising the variable heavy and light chain sequences of the published CD16A- and CD16B-reactive antibody 3G8 recognizes all cell surface expressed CD16A and CD16B antigen variants ( Figure 3 ), but not recombinant EGFR expressed as a specificity control. scFv antibodies containing the variable heavy and light chain sequences of \"LSIV21\" or the affinity-improved \"P2C47\" recognize CHO cell surface expressed CD16A variants but not the mature or propeptide-containing ECD of CD16B(NA1). If however Histidine (H) at position 140 in the CHO membrane-anchored CD16B ECD was mutated to Tyrosine (Y) - the amino acid present at the corresponding position in CD16A - this mutant form of CD16B (CD16BH140Y) was well recognized by scFv antibodies containing the \"LSIV21\" or \"P2C47\" variable domains ( Figure 3 ). ;[0175]    CD16A and CD16BH140Y antigen variants, but not CD16B antigen are also recognized after SDS-PAGE and Western blot when samples are treated under non-reducing conditions, by antibodies containing \"LSIV21\", \"P2C47\" or affinity matured variable domains ( Figure 5 ), whereas Antibody 3G8 recognizes all CD16A and CD16B antigen variants. When samples are reduced prior to loading on SDS-PAGE gels, no signals are obtained on Western blots (data not shown), suggesting a non-linear sequence, but rather three-dimensional structure as the binding epitope. In the case of recognition by \"LSIV21\", \"P2C47\" or affinity matured variants of these antibodies, the three-dimensional epitope structure is likely determined by Tyrosine in position 140 of CD16.\nTable 3: Summary of binding of different anti-CD16 antibodies to coated CD16 antigen variants analyzed in ELISA.

Crucial amino acids for the low-affinity interaction of FcgRIIIA (CD16A) with the Fc part of IgG were previously identified and described (e.g. Ahmed et al., 2016). Residues in CD16A involved in the interaction with the CH2 domain of Fc portions are K120, Y132, H134, H135 and K161. While the antibody 3G8 was reported to bind CD16A and CD16B and block IgG binding (Tamm and Schmidt, 1996), we did not observe blocking of binding of our anti-CD16 antibodies to CD16A by IgGs. To support the hypothesis that the binding site of our anti-CD16A specific antibodies is different from the IgG binding site on FcgRIIIA, we performed a competition ELISA. While binding of 3G8 mAb to CD16A is blocked with increasing concentrations of a scFv antibody containing the variable domains of 3G8, the other anti-CD16 scFv antibodies do not block or displace 3G8 mAb on CD16A and bind independently ( Figure 6 ). Since the 3G8 binding site is known to block IgG binding, we conclude that the binding site of our anti-CD16 antibodies is distinct from the IgG binding site. ;Analysis of binding in ELISA;[0177]    96-well ELISA plates (Immuno MaxiSorp; Nunc) were coated overnight at 4°C with recombinantly produced fusion proteins of CD16 extracellular domain (ECD) antigen variants fused to human IgG1 Fc or monomeric mFc.67 ( Ying et al, 2012, J. Biol. Chem. ) in 100mM Carbonate-bicarbonate buffer at a concentration of 1.5 or 3µg/mL. After a blocking step with 3% (w/v) skim milk powder (Merck) dissolved in PBS, serial dilutions of the different antibodies in PBS containing 0.3% (w/v) skim milk powder were incubated on the plates for 1.5h at room temperature. After washing three times with 300µL per well of PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, plates were incubated with detection antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. For the detection of His-tagged analytes, Penta-HIS-HRP (Qiagen) was used at 1:3000 dilution. For the detection of tetravalent bispecific BCMA/CD16 TandAb antibody, T763, Protein L-HRP conjugate (Pierce) was used at 1:20.000 dilution for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing three times with 300µL per well of PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, plates were incubated with Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Seramun) until color development was clearly visible. The reaction was stopped through the addition of 100µL per well of 0.5M H2SO4. The absorbance was measured at 450nm using a multilabel plate reader (Victor, Perkin Elmer). Absorbance values were plotted and analyzed using nonlinear regression, sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope), least squares (ordinary) fit with GraphPad Prism version 6.07 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA). ;Analysis of binding after SDS-PAGE and Western blot;[0178]    Purified recombinant CD16 antigen variants (human CD16A<48R>, <158V->mFc.67, human CD16B(NA1)<pr>-mFc.67 and huCD16B(NA1)<pr>H140Y-mFc.67 were diluted in PBS to 0,5µg/mL, mixed with an equal volume of non-reducing sample buffer and 8µl of the mix were loaded into the wells of 4-20% Criterion TGX Precast Gels (Biorad). Gels were run at 300V in 1x TGS buffer (Biorad) for 22min and total protein was imaged using the Biorad Molecular Imager Gel Documentation system. Protein was transferred by Western blotting to PVDF Midi Membranes (Biorad) using the Trans-Blot Turbo system (Biorad). Membranes were incubation for 30min with 3% (w/v) skimmed milk powder (Merck) dissolved in TBS to block unspecific binding sites and then incubated with primary antibody dilutions: anti-CD16 antibodies were diluted in TBS containing 3% (w/v) skimmed milk powder to a concentration of 4µg/mL and incubated on the membranes for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing with TBST (TBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) and two times with TBS, membranes were incubated with secondary antibody-detection conjugates: Membranes incubated with anti-CD16A containing scFv-IgAb antibodies were incubated with Protein L-HRP (Pierce), 1:10.000 diluted in TBS containing 3% (w/v) skimmed milk powder, membranes incubated with anti-CD16 scFv antibodies were incubated with anti-Penta-His-HRP (QIAGEN) 1:3000 diluted in TBS containing 3% (w/v) skimmed milk powder, for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing with TBST and two times with TBS, colorimetric development was started by addition of a freshly prepared mixture of 0.66mg/mL DAB, 0,02% CoCl2, 0.015% H2O2 in TBS and incubated on the membranes until color developed. Reaction was stopped by washing membranes in water. Membranes were dried and photographed. ;CD16A competition ELISA;[0179]    96-well ELISA plates (Immuno MaxiSorp; Nunc) were coated overnight at 4°C with recombinantly produced fusion proteins of CD16A(48R, 158V) ECD fused to monomeric mFc.67 ( Ying et al, 2012, J. Biol. Chem. ) in 100mM Carbonate-bicarbonate buffer at a concentration of 1.5µg/mL. After a blocking step with 3% (w/v) skim milk powder (Merck) dissolved in PBS, serial dilutions of the different scFv-antibodies in PBS containing 0.3% (w/v) skim milk powder were mixed with 1nM of anti-CD16 mAb 3G8 (BD Bioscience) and co-incubated on the plates for 1.5h at room temperature. After washing three times with 300µL per well of PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, plates were incubated with detection antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. For the detection of CD16A-bound 3G8, goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L)-HRPO (Dianova 115-035-003) was used at 1:10.000 dilution. After washing three times with 300µL per well of PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, plates were incubated with Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Seramun) until color development was clearly visible.

The buffy coat samples were diluted with a two-to-threefold volume of PBS (Invitrogen, cat.: 14190-169), layered on a cushion of Lymphoprep (Stem Cell Technologies, cat.: 07861) and centrifuged at 800 x g for 25 min at room temperature w/o brake. PBMC located in the interface were collected and washed 3 times with PBS before they were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 IU/mL penicillin G sodium, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin sulfate (all components from Invitrogen) overnight without stimulation.

After repeated washing with FACS buffer, cell-bound antibodies were detected with 10 µg/mL anti-His mAb 13/45/31-2 (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany, cat.: DIA910-1MG) followed by 15 µg/mL FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Dianova, cat.: 115-095-062). After the last staining step, the cells were washed again and resuspended in 0.2 mL of FACS buffer containing 2 µg/mL propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma, cat.: P4170) in order to exclude dead cells. The fluorescence of 2-5 × 103 living cells was measured using a Millipore Guava EasyCyte flow cytometer (Merck Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany) or CytoFlex cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany) and median fluorescence intensities of the cell samples were determined. After subtracting the fluorescence intensity values of the cells stained with the secondary and tertiary reagents alone, the values were used for non-linear regression analysis using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Prism version 7.04 for Windows, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA). For the calculation of KD, the equation for one-site-binding (hyperbola) was used. ;Results;[0182]    The anti-CD16 scFv containing the human Fv domains from clone CD16-1, scFv containing the human anti-CD16 Fv domains from clone CD16-2, and scFv_3G8, containing the murine Fv domains from mAb 3G8 were titrated on primary human NK cells at 37°C in the presence or absence of 10 mg/mL polyclonal human IgG.

Moldenhauer, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany) and KARPAS-299 cells (DSMZ, cat.: ACC31) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 IU/mL penicillin G sodium and 100 µg/mL streptomycin sulfate. All cell lines were cultured under standard conditions and sub-cultured as recommended by the supplier at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. ;Isolation of PBMC from buffy coats and enrichment of human NK cells;[0185]    PBMCs were isolated from buffy coats (German Red Cross, Mannheim, Germany) by density gradient centrifugation. The buffy coat samples were diluted with a two-to-threefold volume of PBS (Invitrogen, cat.: 14190-169), layered on a cushion of Lymphoprep (Stem Cell Technologies, cat.: 07861) and centrifuged at 800 x g for 25 min at room temperature w/o brake. PBMC located in the interface were collected and washed 3 times with PBS before they were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 IU/mL penicillin G sodium and 100 µg/mL streptomycin sulfate (all components from Invitrogen)) overnight without stimulation. For the enrichment of NK cells PBMC were harvested from overnight cultures and used for one round of negative selection using the EasySep<™> Human NK Cell Enrichment Kit (Stem Cell Technologies, cat.: 17055) for the immunomagnetic isolation of untouched human NK cells and the Big Easy EasySep<™> Magnet (Stem Cell Technologies, cat.: 18001) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ;Preloading of NK cells and freeze/thaw;[0186]    Aliquots of enriched primary human NK cells were resuspended in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 µg/mL of the indicated antibody constructs in a total volume of 0.5 mL and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After adding 0.5 mL FCS supplemented with 20% DMSO (Sigma) cell suspensions were then transferred to 2 mL cryo tubes (Greiner bio-one) and frozen at -80°C in cryo 1°C freezing container (Nalgene) for more than 12 h. ;4 h calcein-release cytotoxicity assays;[0187]    For calcein-release cytotoxicity assays the indicated target cells were harvested from cultures, washed with RPMI 1640 medium without FCS, and labeled with 10 µM calcein AM (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, cat.: C3100MP) for 30 min in RPMI medium without FCS at 37°C. After gently washing the labeled cells were resuspended in complete RPMI 1640 medium to a density of 1×10<5>/mL, and aliquots of 1×10<4> target cells were then seeded in individual wells of a 96-well round-bottom micro plate. In parallel, NK cells were thawed from -80°C by incubation of the cryo tubes in a 37°C water bath. When the last ice crystals were visible, the cell suspension was diluted with complete RPMI 1640 medium centrifuged and washed once before the cells were added to the target cells at the indicated effector-to-target (E:T) ratio with or without addition of fresh antibody as indicated in a total volume of 200 µL in duplicates. Spontaneous release was determined by incubation of target cells in the absence of effector cells and without antibodies, and maximal release was induced by the addition of 1% Triton x-100 (final concentration, Roth) and also measured in quadruplicate on each plate. ;[0188]    After centrifugation for 2 min at 200 g the assay was incubated for 4 h at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. 100 µL cell culture supernatant were harvested from each well after an additional centrifugation for 5 min at 500 g, and the fluorescence of the released calcein was measured at 520 nm using a fluorescence multi-plate reader (Victor 3 or EnSight, Perkin Elmer). On the basis of the measured counts, the specific cell lysis was calculated according to the following formula: [fluorescence (sample) - fluorescence (spontaneous)] / [fluorescence (maximum) - fluorescence (spontaneous)] × 100%. Fluorescence (spontaneous) represents the fluorescent counts from target cells in the absence of effector cells and antibodies and fluorescence (maximum) represents the total cell lysis induced by the addition of Triton X-100. Lysis values were analyzed and mean and standard deviation were plotted using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Prism version 7.04 for Windows, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA). ;Results:;[0189]    Primary human NK cells that were pre-loaded with anti-EpCAM antibody constructs, such as EpCAM/NKp46 scFv-lgAb_73, EpCAM/NKG2D scFv-lgAb_75, EpCAM/CD16A scFv-lgAb_80, and IgG anti-EpCAM induced specific lysis of EpCAM-positive COLO 205 cells but not of EpCAM-negative KARPAS-299 cells. Among the bispecific anti-EpCAM constructs, NK cells preloaded with EpCAM/CD16A scFv-lgAb_80 exhibited the highest efficacy in COLO 205 cell lysis and NK cells loaded with EpCAM/NKG2D scFv-lgAb_75 the lowest efficacy. None of the NK cell preparations preloaded with anti-CD30 antibody constructs mediated substantial lysis of COLO 205 ( Figure 8A  and Table 5). ;[0190]    In contrast, NK cells that were pre-loaded with CD30/CD16A TandAb or Fc-enhanced IgG anti-CD30 mediated lysis of CD30-positive KARPAS-299 cells but not of CD30-negative COLO 205 cells. NK cells preloaded with wildtype IgG anti-CD30 did not mediate lysis of KARPAS-299 suggesting that this wildtype IgG anti-CD30 dissociated too fast from NK cells during freezing, thawing and washing, and that the number of remaining IgG was too low to mediate substantial target cell lysis ( Figure 8B  and Table 5). ;[0191]    Interstingly, NK cells that were preloaded with 10 µg/mL EpCAM/NKG2D scFv-lgAb_75 or CD30/CD16A TandAb, frozen, thawed, and washed induced similar lysis of COLO 205 or KARPAS-299 cells, respectively, as NK cells that were not preloaded but supplemented in the cytotoxicity assay with 10 µg/mL of fresh EpCAM/NKG2D scFv-lgAb_75 or CD30/CD16A TandAb.\nTable 5: Efficacy of target cell lysis by pre-loaded and frozen NK cells at an E:T ratio of 5:1. NK cells were preloaded with 10 µg/mL of the indicated antibody constructs or without antibody (w/o antibody) for 30 min at room temperature and then frozen at -80°C. Thawed NK cells were washed and used as effector cells in a 4 h calcein-release cytotoxicity assay on COLO 205 or KARPAS-299 target cells. As a control, EpCAM/NKG2D scFv-lgAb_75 and CD30/CD16A T116 were freshly added at a concentration of 10 µg/mL to NK cells that were not preloaded prior freezing (w/o antibody).

{"patent_number": "EP4191246A1", "description_number": 89, "description_text": "Here, the antigenic determinant of CA19-9 is sialyl Le<a> (NANAα2,3Galβ1,3[Fucα1,4]GlcNAc), which is the common antigenic determinant of human Lewis blood group antigen, Le<a> (Galβ1,3 [Fucα1,4]GlcNAc), and both have the same key enzyme involved in Fucα1,4 sugar chain synthesis. In Japan, approximately less than 20% of humans are negative for the Lewis blood groups and cannot synthesize Fucα1,4 linkages, and therefore, sialyl Le<a> cannot be genetically synthesized, resulting that CA19-9 cannot be a cancer marker in these cases. The present inventors have already found that typing of the Lewis blood group is difficult by a conventional serological tests and that accurate typing is not possible because cancer-related changes of phenotypes occur frequently (see Non-Patent Document 7). For accurate typing of Lewis blood groups, measurement of FUT6 enzyme activity or FUT6 genotyping is required (see Non-Patent Document 8). In addition to these limitations of CA19-9, the results in Table 1 indicate that the sensitivity of CA19-9 measurement for the diagnosis of IPMC is low, and the superiority of fAGP measurement for IPMN diagnosis and IPMC discrimination is clear.", "sdg": "SDG3"}

In some examples, wireless communications system 100 may support millimeter wave (mmW) communications between UEs 115 and base stations 105, and EHF antennas of the respective devices may be even smaller and more closely spaced than UHF antennas. In some cases, this may facilitate use of antenna arrays within a UE 115. However, the propagation of EHF transmissions may be subject to even greater atmospheric attenuation and shorter range than SHF or UHF transmissions. Techniques disclosed herein may be employed across transmissions that use one or more different frequency regions, and designated use of bands across these frequency regions may differ by country or regulating body.", "sdg": "None"}

In the 2013 Global Burden of Disease Study, migraine accounted for over half of all years lost to disability that were attributed to neurological disorders ( New strategies for the treatment and prevention of primary headache disorders, N. M. Schuster & A. M. Rapoport, Nature Reviews Neurology (2016) 12, 635-650 ). While patients with relatively infrequent migraine attacks (for example, occurring once or twice monthly) generally manage their individual attacks by taking medication for acute treatment only when needed, patients with more frequent migraine attacks often are treated with preventive drugs. Four approved oral drugs are currently available for migraine prevention in the US: propranolol, timolol, divalproex sodium, and topiramate. Despite the availability of some oral options for preventive treatment, many patients have poor response or tolerability issues, and an analysis of individuals taking an oral migraine preventive showed poor adherence with only 26% to 29% remaining on drug at 6 months, and 17% to 20% remained on drug at 12 months. Therefore, substantial need remains for alternative orally administered efficacious and well-tolerated agents that can reduce migraine frequency and improve patient functioning.", "sdg": "SDG3"}

{"patent_number": "EP3828199A1", "description_number": 220, "description_text": "For example, the present disclosure contemplates an antibody variant that possesses some but not all effector functions, which make it a desirable candidate for applications in which the half-life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions [e.g., complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)] are unnecessary or deleterious. In vitro and/or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction/depletion of CDC and/or ADCC activities. For example, Fc receptor (FcR) binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks FcγR binding (hence likely lacking ADCC activity), but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express FcγRIII only, whereas monocytes express FcγRI, FcγRII and FcγRIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in, for example,  Ravetch and Kinet (1991) Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9:457-492 . Non-limiting examples of in vitro assays to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest are described in  U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 ;  Hellstrom, I. et al. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Alternatively, non-radioactive assays methods may be employed (e.g., ACTI™, non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay for flow cytometry; CellTechnology, Inc. Mountain View, Calif.; and CytoTox 96® non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay, Promega, Madison, Wis.). Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and natural killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, for example, in an animal model such as that disclosed in  Clynes et al. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:652-656 . C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity [see, e.g., C1q and C3c binding ELISA in  WO 2006/029879  and  WO 2005/100402 ]. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay may be performed [see, e.g,Gazzano-Santoro et al. (1996) J. Immunol. Methods 202:163 ;  Cragg, M. S. et al. (2003) Blood 101:1045-1052 ; and  Cragg, M.

{"patent_number": "EP3961950A1", "description_number": 20, "description_text": "An unlicensed spectrum is a spectrum that is classified by countries and regions and is available to communication of radio devices. The spectrum is generally regarded as a shared spectrum, that is, communication devices in different communication systems may use the spectrum as long as they meet the regulatory requirements configured by countries or regions on the spectrum, without applying for exclusive spectrum authority to the government. In order to enable various communication systems using unlicensed spectrum for wireless communication to coexist amicably on this spectrum, some countries or regions have stipulated the legal requirements that must be met for using unlicensed spectrum. For example, in some regions, a communication device follows a \"Listen Before Talk (LBT)\" principle, that is, before transmitting a signal on a channel of an unlicensed spectrum, the communication device needs to conduct channel listening first, and the communication device can transmit a signal only when a result of channel listening is that the channel is idle. If the result of channel listening by the communication device on the unlicensed spectrum channel is that the channel is busy, the communication device cannot transmit a signal. In order to ensure fairness, in one transmission, a duration in which a communication device uses a channel on the unlicensed spectrum for a signal transmission cannot exceed Maximum Channel Occupation Time (MCOT). With the development of wireless communication technology, both a Long Term Evolution (LTE) system and a New Radio (NR) system will consider network deployment on an unlicensed spectrum to perform data service transmission by using the unlicensed spectrum.", "sdg": "SDG10"}

Here, in the branched structure, the number of chains including the skeleton of Formula 2 or 3 above linked as the side chain may be, for example, 1 to 5, 1 to 4, 1 to 3, 1 to 2, or 1. ;[0072]    In one example, the polyol compound having a polyester skeleton may be a compound in the form that at least some of hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon compound such as an alkane, alkene or alkyne are substituted with the hydroxyl group and/or the skeleton of Formula 3 above. The number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon compound such as the alkane, alkene or alkyne may be, for example, 1 to 20, 1 to 16, 1 to 8, or 4 to 6. ;[0073]    Such a hydrocarbon compound such as the alkane, alkene or alkyne may be linear, branched, or cyclic. In addition, the hydroxyl group and/or the skeleton of Formula 3 may be substituted on the same carbon atom in the alkane, alkene, or alkyne, or may also be substituted on different carbon atoms. ;[0074]    In one example, the polyether skeleton may be a skeleton having a repeating unit of Formula 5 below.\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8c8f92b9-616d-46b7-9113-89d48615c068-ib0006\" />;\n[0075]    In Formula 5, X4 and X5 are each independently a single bond or an oxygen atom, L2 may be an alkylene group, and m is an arbitrary number. ;[0076]    In Formula 5, the alkylene group may be, in one example, an alkylene group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, 1 to 16 carbon atoms, 1 to 12 carbon atoms, 1 to 8 carbon atoms, or 1 to 4 carbon atoms, which may be linear or branched. ;[0077]    In Formula 5, m is an arbitrary number representing the number of repeating units, which may be, for example, a number within the range of 1 to 25. ;[0078]    The lower limit of m in Formula 5 may be 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21 or 23 or so, and the upper limit may be 25, 23, 21, 19, 17, 15, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5 or 3 or so. The m may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0079]    In the polyol compound having a skeleton of Formula 5, the hydroxyl group or the above-described hydrocarbon group may be present at the terminal of the skeleton of Formula 5 above. ;[0080]    In this case, the skeleton of Formula 5 above may be represented by Formula 6 below.\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8c8f92b9-616d-46b7-9113-89d48615c068-ib0007\" />;\n[0081]    In Formula 6, X4, X5, L2 and m are as defined in Formula 5, and R2 may be a hydroxyl group or a substituent of Formula 7 below.\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8c8f92b9-616d-46b7-9113-89d48615c068-ib0008\" />;\n[0082]    In Formula 7, X6 is a single bond or an oxygen atom, and R is the same as R in Formula 1 above. ;[0083]    When R2 in Formula 6 is a hydroxy group, X4 is a single bond, and when R2 is a substituent of Formula 7, either one of X4 and X6 is a single bond, and the other is an oxygen atom. ;[0084]    The lower limit of the number of skeletons of Formula 5 or 6 above included in the polyol compound may be 1 or 2 or so, and the upper limit thereof may be 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 or 2 or so. The number of skeletons may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0085]    The polyol compound having a polyether skeleton may have a linear or branched structure. ;[0086]    Here, the linear structure may be a structure in which a main chain including a skeleton of Formula 5 or 6 above is present and no other polymer chain is linked to the main chain, and the branched structure may be in a form that as a side chain, a chain including a skeleton of Formula 5 or 6 above is bonded to a main chain including a skeleton of Formula 5 or 6 above. Here, in the branched structure, the number of chains containing the skeleton of Formula 5 or 6 above linked as side chains may be, for example, 1 to 5, 1 to 4, 1 to 3, 1 to 2, or 1. ;[0087]    In one example, the polyol compound having the polyether skeleton may be a compound in the form that at least some of hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon compound such as an alkane, alkene or alkyne are substituted with a hydroxyl group and/or a skeleton of Formula 5 above. The number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon compound such as the alkane, alkene or alkyne may be, for example, 1 to 20, 1 to 16, 1 to 8, or 4 to 6. ;[0088]    Such a hydrocarbon compound such as the alkane, alkene or alkyne may be linear, branched, or cyclic. In addition, the hydroxy group and/or the skeleton of Formula 5 may be substituted on the same carbon atom in the alkane, alkene, or alkyne, or may also be substituted on different carbon atoms. ;[0089]    When the above-described polyol compound is an oligomeric or polymeric compound, the relevant compound may have an appropriate level of molecular weight. ;[0090]    For example, the lower limit of the weight average molecular weight of the oligomeric or polymeric polyol compound may be 100 g/mol, 200 g/mol, 300 g/mol, 400 g/mol, 500 g/mol, 600 g/mol, 700 g/mol, 800 g/mol or 900 g/mol or so, and the upper limit may also be 5000 g/mol, 4500 g/mol, 4000 g/mol, 3500 g/mol, 3000 g/mol, 2500 g/mol, 2000 g/mol, 1500 g/mol, 1000 g/mol or 800 g/mol or so. The weight average molecular weight may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0091]    By applying the oil-modified polyol as described above, it is possible to more effectively secure desired physical properties. ;[0092]    The oil-modified polyol compound may be present in an appropriate ratio in the resin composition. For example, the lower limit of the content of the oil-modified polyol compound in the resin composition may be 5 wt%, 10 wt%, 15 wt%, 20 wt%, 25 wt%, 30 wt%, 35 wt%, 40 wt%, 45 wt%, 50 wt%, 55 wt%, 60 wt%, 65 wt%, 70 wt%, 75 wt%, 80 wt%, 85 wt%, 90 wt% or 95 wt% or so, and the upper limit thereof may be 100 wt%, 95 wt%, 90 wt%, 85 wt%, 80 wt%, 75 wt%, 70 wt%, 65 wt%, 60 wt%, 55 wt%, 50 wt%, 45 wt%, 40 wt%, 35 wt%, 30 wt%, 25 wt% or 20 wt% or so. The content may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0093]    When the resin composition is a one-component type, the content of the oil-modified polyol compound is the content in the relevant one-component resin composition, and when it is a two-component composition, it is the content in the part where the oil-modified polyol compound is present. For example, when the two-component resin composition comprises a main part and a curing agent part that are physically separated, and the oil-modified polyol compound is included in the main part, the content of the oil-modified polyol may be a content based on the total weight of the main part. In addition, when the resin composition comprises a solvent and/or a filler, the content is a content based on weight excluding the contents of the solvent and filler. ;[0094]    In another example, the content of the oil-modified polyol compound may be a content based on 100 wt% of all polyol components present in the resin composition. ;[0095]    In another example, when the resin composition comprises a filler component to be described below, the lower limit of the content of the oil-modified polyol compound relative to 100 parts by weight of the filler component may be 1 part by weight, 3 parts by weight, 5 parts by weight, 7 parts by weight, 9 parts by weight, 11 parts by weight or 13 parts by weight or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 40 parts by weight, 35 parts by weight, 30 parts by weight, 25 parts by weight, 20 parts by weight, 15 parts by weight, 10 parts by weight, 8 parts by weight, 6 parts by weight, 4 parts by weight or 3 parts by weight or so. The content may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0096]    When the resin composition is a one-component type, the ratio to the filler component is the ratio relative to 100 parts by weight of the entire filler component included in the relevant resin composition, and in the case of a two-component type, it is the ratio relative to 100 parts by weight of the entire filler component present in the part (main part or curing agent part) where the oil-modified polyol is included. ;[0097]    The hydroxy functional component may, if necessary, also comprise an alcohol compound as an additional component. The term alcohol compound means a compound containing one hydroxy group per molecule. Such an alcohol compound may be a monomolecular, oligomeric, or polymeric compound. ;[0098]    As the alcohol compound, an oil-modified alcohol compound may also be used. The term oil-modified alcohol compound means a compound containing one hydroxy group per molecule and at the same time containing at least one oil group, i.e., a linear or branched hydrocarbon group having 3 or more carbon atoms at its terminal. Here, the method for confirming the number of hydroxyl groups and the number of hydrocarbon groups is the same as that of the polyol compound. Such an alcohol compound may be a monomolecular, oligomeric, or polymeric compound. As such an oil-modified alcohol compound is applied together with the above-described oil-modified polyol compound to be formed as a polyurethane material, it is possible to secure low adhesion force to a specific material while using an adhesion force reducing component such as a plasticizer or minimizing the used amount. ;[0099]    The oil-modified alcohol compound may have a form similar to that of the oil-modified polyol compound, except that it contains one hydroxyl group per molecule. Therefore, the description of the oil-modified polyol compound may be equally applied to the oil-modified alcohol compound. ;[0100]    That is, for example, the lower limit of the number of carbon atoms in the linear or branched hydrocarbon group present in the oil-modified alcohol compound may be 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, or 17 or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11 or 10 or so. The number of carbon atoms may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0101]    The linear or branched hydrocarbon group may or may not contain double bonds. In the case of including the double bonds, such double bonds may be conjugated double bonds or cis double bonds. ;[0102]    A specific type of the hydrocarbon group may be exemplified by an alkyl group, an alkenyl group, or an alkynyl group. In one example, the hydrocarbon group may be linked to the alcohol compound via a carbonyl group or a carbonyloxy group, and in this case, the hydrocarbon group may be an alkylcarbonyl group, an alkenylcarbonyl group, an alkynylcarbonyl group, an alkylcarbonyloxy group, an alkenylcarbonyloxy group, or an alkynylcarbonyloxy group. ;[0103]    The lower limit of the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group, alkenyl group or alkynyl group may be 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, or 17 or so, and the upper limit thereof may be 50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11 or 10 or so. The number of carbon atoms may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0104]    The alkyl group, alkenyl group, or alkynyl group may be linear or branched, and may be optionally substituted with one or more substituents. When the substituent is present, the type of the substituent is not particularly limited, and for example, a halogen atom such as fluorine may be exemplified as the substituent. ;[0105]    In one example, the hydrocarbon of the oil-modified alcohol compound may also be included in the substituent of Formula 1 above. In this instance, the detailed matters of the substituent of Formula 1 are also the same as in the case of the oil-modified polyol compound. ;[0106]    The number of hydrocarbon groups included in the alcohol compound is not particularly limited, but in one example, the lower limit of the number of hydrocarbon groups included in the alcohol compound may be 1 or 2 or so per molecule, and the upper limit thereof may also be 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 or 2 or so per molecule. The number of carbon atoms may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0107]    The alcohol compound may have various forms if it includes the hydroxy group and the hydrocarbon group. ;[0108]    In one example, the alcohol compound may be a compound in the form that at least some of hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon compound such as an alkane, alkene or alkyne are substituted with the hydroxy groups and/or the hydrocarbon groups. The number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon compound such as the alkane, alkene or alkyne may be, for example, 1 to 20, 1 to 16, 1 to 8, or 4 to 6. ;[0109]    Such a hydrocarbon compound such as the alkane, alkene or alkyne may be linear, branched, or cyclic. In addition, the hydroxyl groups and/or hydrocarbon groups in the alkane, alkene, or alkyne may be substituted on the same carbon atom, or may also be substituted on different carbon atoms. ;[0110]    In another example, the alcohol compound may be a compound having a polyester skeleton or a polyether skeleton. In this case, the alcohol compound may be an oligomeric compound or a polymeric compound. ;[0111]    Like the case of the polyol compound, the polyester skeleton may be a so-called polycaprolactone skeleton, and the polyether skeleton may be a so-called polyalkylene skeleton. ;[0112]    In one example, the polyester skeleton may be a skeleton having a repeating unit represented by Formula 2 above. In this instance, the specific contents of the repeating unit of Formula 2 are the same as those of the polyol compound. ;[0113]    Therefore, even in the case of the oil-modified alcohol compound, the hydroxy group or the above-described hydrocarbon group in the alcohol compound having the skeleton of Formula 2 above may be present at the terminal of the skeleton of Formula 2 above, and in this case, the skeleton of Formula 2 above may be represented by Formula 3 above. In this instance, the specific contents of the skeleton of Formula 3 are the same as those of the polyol compound. ;[0114]    The lower limit of the number of skeletons of Formula 2 or 3 above in the alcohol compound may be 1 or 2 on the premise that the compound contains one hydroxyl group per molecule, and the upper limit thereof may be 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 or 2 or so. The number of skeletons may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0115]    The alcohol compound having the polyester skeleton may also have a linear or branched structure. ;[0116]    Here, the linear structure is a structure in which a main chain including a skeleton of Formula 2 or 3 above is present and no other polymer chain is linked to the main chain, and the branched structure may be in a form that as a side chain, a chain including a skeleton of Formula 2 or 3 above is bonded to the main chain including a skeleton of Formula 2 or 3 above. Here, in the branched structure, the number of chains including the skeleton of Formula 2 or 3 above linked as the side chain may be, for example, 1 to 5, 1 to 4, 1 to 3, 1 to 2, or 1. ;[0117]    In one example, the alcohol compound having a polyester skeleton may also be a compound in the form that at least some of hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon compound such as an alkane, alkene or alkyne are substituted with the hydroxyl group and/or the skeleton of Formula 3 above. The number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon compound such as the alkane, alkene or alkyne may be, for example, 1 to 20, 1 to 16, 1 to 8, or 4 to 6. ;[0118]    Such a hydrocarbon compound such as the alkane, alkene or alkyne may be linear, branched, or cyclic. In addition, the hydroxyl group and/or the skeleton of Formula 3 may be substituted on the same carbon atom in the alkane, alkene, or alkyne, or may also be substituted on different carbon atoms. ;[0119]    In one example, the polyether skeleton of the alcohol compound may also be a skeleton having a repeating unit represented by Formula 5 above. In this instance, the specific contents of Formula 5 are the same as those of the polyol compound. ;[0120]    Even in an alcohol compound having a skeleton of Formula 5, the hydroxy group or the above-described hydrocarbon group may be present at the terminal of the skeleton of Formula 5 above, which may be a skeleton of Formula 6. In this instance, the specific contents of Formula 6 are the same as those of the polyol compound. ;[0121]    The lower limit of the number of skeletons of Formula 5 or 6 above included in the alcohol compound may be about 1 or 2 or so on the premise that the alcohol compound has one hydroxyl group per molecule, and the upper limit thereof may be 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 or 2 or so. The number of skeletons may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0122]    The alcohol compound having a polyether skeleton may have a linear or branched structure. ;[0123]    Here, the linear structure may be a structure in which a main chain including a skeleton of Formula 5 or 6 above is present and no other polymer chain is linked to the main chain, and the branched structure may be in a form that as a side chain, a chain including a skeleton of Formula 5 or 6 above is bonded to a main chain including a skeleton of Formula 5 or 6 above. Here, in the branched structure, the number of chains containing the skeleton of Formula 5 or 6 above linked as side chains may be, for example, 1 to 5, 1 to 4, 1 to 3, 1 to 2, or 1. ;[0124]    In one example, the alcohol compound having the polyether skeleton may be a compound in the form that at least some of hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon compound such as an alkane, alkene or alkyne are substituted with a hydroxyl group and/or a skeleton of Formula 5 above. The number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon compound such as the alkane, alkene or alkyne may be, for example, 1 to 20, 1 to 16, 1 to 8, or 4 to 6. ;[0125]    Such a hydrocarbon compound such as the alkane, alkene or alkyne may be linear, branched, or cyclic. In addition, the hydroxy group and/or the skeleton of Formula 5 may be substituted on the same carbon atom in the alkane, alkene, or alkyne, or may also be substituted on different carbon atoms. ;[0126]    When the above-described alcohol compound is an oligomeric or polymeric compound, the relevant compound may have an appropriate level of molecular weight. ;[0127]    For example, the lower limit of the weight average molecular weight of the oligomeric or polymeric alcohol compound may be 10 g/mol, 200 g/mol, 300 g/mol, 400 g/mol, 500 g/mol, 600 g/mol, 700 g/mol, 800 g/mol, 900 g/mol, 1000 g/mol, 1200 g/mol, 1400 g/mol, 1600 g/mol or 1800 g/mol or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 5000 g/mol, 4500 g/mol, 4000 g/mol, 3500 g/mol, 3000 g/mol, 2500 g/mol, 2000 g/mol, 1500 g/mol, 1000 g/mol or 800 g/mol or so. The weight average molecular weight may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0128]    By applying the oil-modified polyol as described above, it is possible to more effectively secure desired physical properties. ;[0129]    The lower limit of the content of the oil-modified alcohol compound relative to 100 parts by weight of the oil-modified polyol compound may be 10 parts by weight, 20 parts by weight, 30 parts by weight, 40 parts by weight, 50 parts by weight, 60 parts by weight, 70 parts by weight, 80 parts by weight, 90 parts by weight, 100 parts by weight, 110 parts by weight, 120 parts by weight, 130 parts by weight, 140 parts by weight, 150 parts by weight, 160 parts by weight, 170 parts by weight, 180 parts by weight, 190 parts by weight, 200 parts by weight, 210 parts by weight, 220 parts by weight, 230 parts by weight, 240 parts by weight, 250 parts by weight, 260 parts by weight, 270 parts by weight, 280 parts by weight, 290 parts by weight or 300 parts by weight or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 1,000 parts by weight, 950 parts by weight, 900 parts by weight, 850 parts by weight, 800 parts by weight, 750 parts by weight, 700 parts by weight, 650 parts by weight, 600 parts by weight, 550 parts by weight, 500 parts by weight, 450 parts by weight, 400 parts by weight, 350 parts by weight, 300 parts by weight, 250 parts by weight, 200 parts by weight, 150 parts by weight, 100 parts by weight, 90 parts by weight, 80 parts by weight, 70 parts by weight or 60 parts by weight or so. The ratio may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0130]    The ratio of the oil-modified polyol compound may be changed in consideration of the overall composition or desired physical properties of the resin composition. ;[0131]    Among the polyol components in the hydroxy functional component, a component comprising only the oil-modified polyol compound and the oil-modified alcohol compound may be referred to as an oil-modified component. In this case, the lower limit of the entire weight average molecular weight of such an oil-modified component may be 10 g/mol, 200g/mol, 300 g/mol, 400 g/mol, 500 g/mol, 600 g/mol, 700 g/mol, 800 g/mol, 900 g/mol, 1000 g/mol, 1200 g/mol, 1400 g/mol, 1600 g/mol or 1800 g/mol or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 5,000 g/mol, 4500 g/mol, 4000 g/mol, 3500 g/mol, 3000 g/mol, 2500 g/mol, 2000 g/mol, 1500 g/mol, 1000 g/mol or 800 g/mol or so. The weight average molecular weight may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0132]    The oil-modified polyol compound or alcohol compound may be synthesized through a known synthesis method. That is, the compounds may be prepared by reacting a compound capable of introducing the hydrocarbon group corresponding to the oil-modified portion with a known polyol compound. At this time, the compound capable of introducing the hydrocarbon group may be exemplified by saturated or unsaturated fatty acids, and specifically, may be exemplified by butyric acid, caproic acid, 2-ethylhexanoic acid, caprylic acid, isononanoic acid, capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, or oleic acid, and the like, but is not limited thereto. In the above process, by adjusting the reaction ratio of the fatty acid and the polyol compound, a mixture (oil-modified component) comprising the polyol compound and the alcohol compound may also be optionally prepared. ;[0133]    In addition, the type of polyol compound reacting with the saturated or unsaturated fatty acid is not particularly limited, and for example, an appropriate type of general polyol compounds to be described below may be applied, but is not limited thereto. ;[0134]    The resin composition may further comprise a polyol compound different from the oil-modified polyol compound as the polyol compound. In this case, the polyol compound does not contain the above-described oil group, that is, the linear or branched hydrocarbon group having 3 or more carbon atoms. For convenience, such a polyol compound may be referred to as a general polyol compound in this specification. ;[0135]    The lower limit of the number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon group that the general polyol compound does not contain may be 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, or 17 or so, and the upper limit thereof may be 50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11 or 10 or so. The number of carbon atoms may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. In one example, the hydrocarbon group may be an alkyl group, an alkenyl group, or an alkynyl group having the number of carbon atoms. ;[0136]    The general polyol compound may contain two or more hydroxy groups per molecule, and such a polyol compound may be a monomolecular, oligomeric, or polymeric compound. The number of hydroxy groups included in the general polyol compound is not particularly limited, but in one example, the lower limit of the number of hydroxy groups included in the general polyol compound may be 2 or 3 or so per molecule, and the lower limit thereof may also be 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 or 2 or so per molecule. The number of hydroxy groups may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0137]    The general polyol compound may have various forms. ;[0138]    In one example, the general polyol compound may be a polyester polyol. As the polyester polyol, for example, a so-called carboxylic acid polyol or caprolactone polyol may be used. ;[0139]    In one example, the polyester polyol may be a skeleton having a repeating unit represented by Formula 8 below.\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8c8f92b9-616d-46b7-9113-89d48615c068-ib0009\" />\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8c8f92b9-616d-46b7-9113-89d48615c068-ib0010\" />;\n[0140]    In Formula 8, X7 and X8 are each independently a single bond or an oxygen atom, L3 may be an alkylene group, and p is an arbitrary number. ;[0141]    In Formula 8 above, the alkylene group may be, in one example, an alkylene group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, 4 to 20 carbon atoms, 4 to 16 carbon atoms, 4 to 12 carbon atoms, or 4 to 8 carbon atoms, which may be linear or branched. ;[0142]    When the polyester polyol is a polycaprolactone polyol, L3 of Formula 8 above may be a linear alkylene group with 5 carbon atoms. ;[0143]    Also, in Formula 8 above, p is an arbitrary number representing the number of repeating units, which may be, for example, a number within the range of 1 to 25. ;[0144]    The lower limit of p in Formula 8 above may be 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21 or 23 or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 25, 23, 21, 19, 17, 15, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5 or 3 or so. The p may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0145]    The polyester polyol having the skeleton of Formula 8 above may be a so-called carboxylic acid polyol or caprolactone polyol. Such a polyol compound may be formed by a known method, and for example, the carboxylic acid polyol may be formed by reacting a component including a carboxylic acid and a polyol (e.g., diol or triol, etc.), and the caprolactone polyol may be formed by reacting a component including caprolactone and a polyol (e.g., diol or triol, etc.). The carboxylic acid may be a dicarboxylic acid. ;[0146]    In the polyol compound having the skeleton of Formula 8 above, the hydroxyl group may be present at the terminal of the skeleton of Formula 8 above or at another site of the polyester polyol. ;[0147]    The lower limit of the number of skeletons of Formula 8 above included in the general polyol compound may be 1 or 2, and the upper limit thereof may be 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 or so. The number of skeletons may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0148]    The polyol compound having a polyester skeleton may have a linear or branched structure. ;[0149]    Here, the linear structure may be a structure in which a main chain including the skeleton of Formula 8 above is present and no other polymer chain is linked to the main chain, and the branched structure may be in a form that as side chains, chains including the skeleton of Formula 8 above are bonded to a main chain including the skeleton of Formula 8 above. In the branched structure, the number of chains containing the skeleton of Formula 8 above linked as the side chains may be, for example, 1 to 5, 1 to 4, 1 to 3, 1 to 2, or 1. ;[0150]    In another example, a polyol having an alkane diol unit, a polyol unit, and a dicarboxylic acid unit may also be used as the general polyol compound. Such a polyol may be a mixture of the above alkane diol, polyol and dicarboxylic acid, or a reactant thereof. At this time, the alkane diol may be exemplified by a diol compound with 1 to 20 carbon atoms, 4 to 20 carbon atoms, 4 to 16 carbon atoms, or 4 to 12 carbon atoms, such as 3-methyl-1,5-pentanediol, 1,9-nonanediol or 1,6-hexanediol. In addition, the polyol may be exemplified by an alkane with 1 to 20 carbon atoms, 4 to 20 carbon atoms, 4 to 16 carbon atoms or 4 to 12 carbon atoms substituted with 3 to 10, 3 to 9, 3 to 8, 3 to 7, 3 to 6, 3 to 5, or 3 to 4 hydroxyl groups, such as trimethylolpropane. In addition, the dicarboxylic acid may be exemplified by adipic acid, terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, or sebacic acid, and the like. The polyol compound of this kind is known as, for example, product names of Kuraray's P-510, P-1010, P-2010, P-3010, P-4010, P-5010, P-6010, F-510, F-1010, F- 2010, F-3010, P-2011, P-520, P-2020, P-1012, P-2012, P-630, P-2030, P-2050, or N-2010, and the like. ;[0151]    As the general polyol, a polyol having a weight average molecular weight in a range of 100 g/mol to 5,000 g/mol may be used. The desired effect can be more effectively achieved through the application of such a polyol. ;[0152]    When the general polyol compound is included, the lower limit of the weight ratio of the general polyol compound relative to 100 parts by weight of the oil-modified polyol compound may be 1 part by weight, 3 parts by weight, 5 parts by weight, 7 parts by weight, 10 parts by weight, 15 parts by weight, 20 parts by weight, 25 parts by weight, 30 parts by weight, 35 parts by weight, 40 parts by weight, 45 parts by weight, 50 parts by weight, 55 parts by weight, 60 parts by weight, 65 parts by weight, 70 parts by weight, 75 parts by weight, 80 parts by weight, 85 parts by weight, 90 parts by weight, 95 parts by weight or 100 parts by weight or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 200 parts by weight, 190 parts by weight, 180 parts by weight, 170 parts by weight, 160 parts by weight, 150 parts by weight, 140 parts by weight, 130 parts by weight, 120 parts by weight, 110 parts by weight, 100 parts by weight, 90 parts by weight, 80 parts by weight, 70 parts by weight, 60 parts by weight, 50 parts by weight, 40 parts by weight, 30 parts by weight, 20 parts by weight or 10 parts by weight or so. The ratio may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0153]    In another example, when the general polyol compound is included, the lower limit of the content ratio of the general polyol compound relative to 100 parts by weight of the sum of the oil-modified polyol and the oil-modified alcohol may be 1 part by weight, 5 parts by weight, 10 parts by weight, 15 parts by weight, 20 parts by weight, 25 parts by weight, 30 parts by weight, 35 parts by weight or 40 parts by weight or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 200 parts by weight, 190 parts by weight, 180 parts by weight, 170 parts by weight, 160 parts by weight, 150 parts by weight, 140 parts by weight, 130 parts by weight, 120 parts by weight, 110 parts by weight, 100 parts by weight, 90 parts by weight, 80 parts by weight, 70 parts by weight, 60 parts by weight, 50 parts by weight, 40 parts by weight, 30 parts by weight, 20 parts by weight or 10 parts by weight or so. The ratio may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0154]    The ratio may be changed in consideration of the composition or intended use of the entire resin composition. ;[0155]    The resin composition may comprise, as an additional component, a curing agent that reacts with the polyol compound and/or alcohol compound. ;[0156]    As the curing agent, various types may be applied, but when the resin composition is the polyurethane composition, a polyisocyanate may be applied as the curing agent. The term polyisocyanate means a compound having two or more isocyanate groups. The lower limit of the number of isocyanate groups in the polyisocyanate may be 2 or 3 or so, and the upper limit thereof may be 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 or 2 or so. The number of the isocyanate groups may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0157]    The type of polyisocyanate used as the curing agent is not particularly limited, but a non-aromatic polyisocyanate containing no aromatic group may be used to secure desired physical properties. ;[0158]    As the polyisocyanate compound, for example, aliphatic polyisocyanates such as hexamethylene diisocyanate, trimethylhexamethylene diisocyanate, lysine diisocyanate, norbornane diisocyanate methyl, ethylene diisocyanate, propylene diisocyanate, or tetramethylene diisocyanate; alicyclic polyisocyanates such as transcyclohexane-1,4-diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, bis(isocyanatemethyl)cyclohexane diisocyanate, or dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate; or one or more carbodiimide-modified polyisocyanates or isocyanurate-modified polyisocyanates of the foregoing, and the like may be used. In addition, as the polyisocyanate, addition reaction products of the diisocyanate and polyol (for example, trimethylol propane, etc.) as described above may also be used. Furthermore, a mixture of two or more of the above-listed compounds may be used. ;[0159]    The application rate of the polyisocyanate may be adjusted in consideration of the number of hydroxy groups present in the hydroxy functional component included in the resin composition, and physical properties after curing. ;[0160]    For example, the polyisocyanate may be included in the resin composition so that an equivalent ratio (OH/NCO) of the number (OH) of hydroxy groups present in the hydroxy functional component present in the resin composition to the number (NCO) of isocyanate groups present in the polyisocyanate (NCO)may be within a range of 50 to 1,000. ;[0161]    A method for calculating the equivalence ratio (OH/NCO) is known. ;[0162]    For example, if the resin composition is a two-component type, the hydroxy functional component is included in the main part, and the polyisocyanate is included in the curing agent part, the equivalent ratio OH/NCO can be calculated according to the following general equation 1. Equivalent Ratio OH / NCO = D 1 × ∑ W 1 × OH % D 2 × ∑ W 2 × NCO % × DN DO\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8c8f92b9-616d-46b7-9113-89d48615c068-ib0011\" />;\n[0163]    In General Equation 1, D1 is the density of the main part, D2 is the density of the curing agent part, Wi is the weight ratio of the polyol compound or alcohol compound present in the main part, OH% is the ratio of hydroxy groups included in the polyol compound or alcohol compound having the weight ratio of W1, W2 is the weight ratio of polyisocyanate present in the curing agent part, NCO% is the ratio of isocyanate groups included in the polyisocyanate having the weight ratio of W2, DN is 42Da as the dalton mass of the isocyanate group, and DO is 17 Da as the dalton mass of the hydroxy group. ;[0164]    The Wi is the weight% (based on the total weight of the main part) in the main part of each polyol compound or alcohol compound present in the main part, and OH% of the relevant compound is the % of the hydroxy group included in 1 mole of each polyol compound or alcohol compound, which is obtained by dividing the product of the molar number of hydroxy groups included in a single polyol compound or alcohol compound and the molar mass of the hydroxy group by the molar mass of the single polyol compound or alcohol compound and then multiplying by 100. ;[0165]    Here, W2 is the weight% (based on the total weight of the curing agent part) in the curing agent part of each polyisocyanate present in the curing agent part, and NCO% of the relevant compound is the % of the NCO group included in 1 mole of each polyisocyanate compound, which is obtained by dividing the product of the molar number of NCO groups included in a single polyisocyanate compound and the molar mass of the NCO group by the molar mass of the single polyisocyanate compound and then multiplying by 100. ;[0166]    Also, in General Equation 1 above, the dalton mass is a constant. ;[0167]    The lower limit of the equivalent ratio (OH/NCO) may be 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250 or 260 or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 1000, 900, 800, 700, 600, 500, 400, 300, 290, 280, 270, 260, 250, 240, 230, 220, 210, 200, 190, 180, 170, 160, 150, 140, 130, 120, 110 or 100 or so. The equivalent ratio may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, or may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0168]    The resin composition may further comprise a filler component. The term filler component means a component composed of a filler, that is, a component comprising only a filler. ;[0169]    In one example, the filler component may comprise two or more fillers having different average particle diameters. In one example, the filler component may comprise three or more fillers having different average particle diameters, or may be composed of three to six, three to five, three to four, or three fillers, having different average particle diameters. That is, in one example, the filler component may also comprise only three to six, three to five, three to four, or three fillers, having different average particle diameters. ;[0170]    In another example, the filler component may exhibit at least two peaks in a volume curve of a particle size distribution measured using laser diffraction. In one example, the filler component may exhibit three or more peaks in the volume curve of the particle size distribution, or may exhibit three to six, three to five, three to four, or three peaks. For example, in the range of the filler component exhibiting three peaks, the filler component exhibiting one, two, or four or more peaks is not included. ;[0171]    The average particle diameter in the filler of the present application means a particle diameter at which the volume accumulation becomes 50% in the volume curve of the particle size distribution measured by laser diffraction, which may also be referred to as a median diameter. That is, in the present application, the particle size distribution is obtained on a volume basis through the laser diffraction, and the particle diameter at the point where the cumulative value becomes 50% in the cumulative curve with 100% of the total volume is set as the average particle diameter, and in another example, such an average particle diameter may be referred to as a median particle size or a D50 particle diameter. ;[0172]    Therefore, here, the two fillers having different average particle diameters may mean fillers having different particle diameters at the point where the cumulative value becomes 50% in the volume curve of the particle size distribution. ;[0173]    When two or more fillers having different average particle diameters are usually mixed in order to form a filler component, as many peaks as the types of mixed fillers appear on the volume curve of the particle size distribution measured using laser diffraction with respect to the filler component. Therefore, for example, when three fillers having different average particle diameters are mixed to constitute a filler component, the volume curve of the particle size distribution measured using the laser diffraction regarding the filler component shows three peaks. ;[0174]    The filler component of the resin composition of the present application may be a thermally conductive filler component. The term thermally conductive filler component means a filler component functioning so that the resin composition or the cured body thereof exhibits the above-described thermal conductivity. ;[0175]    In one example, the filler component may comprise at least a first filler having an average particle diameter of 60 µm to 200 µm, a second filler having an average particle diameter in a range of 10 µm to 30 µm, and a third filler having an average particle diameter of 5 µm or less. ;[0176]    The lower limit of the average particle diameter of the first filler may be 62 µm, 62 µm, 64 µm, 66 µm or 68 µm or so, and the upper limit thereof may be 200 µm, 195 µm, 190 µm, 185 µm, 180 µm, 175 µm, 170 µm, 165 µm, 160 µm, 155 µm, 150 µm, 145 µm, 140 µm, 135 µm, 130 µm, 125 µm, about 120 µm, 115 µm, 110 µm, 105 µm, 100 µm, 95 µm, 90 µm, 85 µm, 80 µm or about 75 µm or so. The average particle diameter of the first filler may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0177]    The lower limit of the average particle diameter of the second filler may be 10 µm, 12 µm, 13 µm, 14 µm, 15 µm, 16 µm, 17 µm, 18 µm, 19 µm, or 20 µm or so, and the upper limit thereof may be 29 µm, 28 µm, 27 µm, 26 µm, 25 µm, 24 µm, 23 µm, 22 µm, 21 µm or about 20 µm or so. The average particle diameter of the second filler may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0178]    The lower limit of the third filler may be 0.01 µm, 0.1 µm, about 0.5 µm, 1 µm, 1.5 µm, or 2 µm or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 5 µm, 4.5 µm, about 4 µm, 3.5 µm, 3 µm, 2.5 µm or 2 µm or so. The average particle diameter of the third filler may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0179]    The ratio (D1/D3) of the average particle diameter (D1) of the first filler to the average particle diameter (D3) of the third filler in the filler component may be in a range of 25 to 300. ;[0180]    In one example, the third filler may be a filler having the smallest average particle diameter among fillers included in the filler component when the filler component comprises two or more fillers having different average particle diameters, and the first filler may be a filler having the largest average particle diameter among fillers included in the filler component when the filler component comprises two or more fillers having different average particle diameters. In such a state, the particle diameter ratio may be satisfied. ;[0181]    The lower limit of the ratio (D1/D3) may be 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230 or 235 or so, and the upper limit thereof may be 300, 290, 280, 270, 260, 250, 240, 220, 200, 180, 160, 140, 120, 100, 95, 90, 85, 80, 75, 70, 65 or 60 or so. The ratio may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0182]    In the filler component, the lower limit of the ratio (D1/D2) of the average particle diameter (D1) of the first filler to the average particle diameter (D2) of the second filler may be 3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, or 3.5 or so, or may also be 20, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 or 4 or so. The ratio may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0183]    As the filler, for example, a ceramic material such as aluminum oxide (alumina: Al2O3), aluminum nitride (AlN), boron nitride (BN), silicon nitride (Si3N4), silicon carbide (SiC), beryllium oxide (BeO), zinc oxide (ZnO), magnesium oxide (MgO), aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3), magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2), calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and/or boehmite may be used. Such a filler is advantageous in satisfying the thermal conductivity within the above-mentioned range, and additionally, the above-described insulation properties and the like may also be satisfied through the application of a ceramic filler. ;[0184]    The upper limit of the proportion of the filler component in the resin composition may be 99 wt%, 98 wt%, 97 wt%, 96 wt%, 95 wt%, 94.5 wt%, 94 wt%, 93.5 wt%, 93 wt%, 92.5 wt%, 92 wt%, 91.5 wt%, 91 wt%, 90.5 wt%, 90.0 wt%, 89.5 wt%, 89.0 wt%, 88.5 wt% or 88.0 wt% or so, and the lower limit thereof may be about 70 wt%, 71 wt%, 72 wt%, 73 wt%, 74 wt%, about 75 wt%, 76 wt%, 77 wt%, 78 wt%, 79 wt%, 80 wt%, 81 wt%, 82 wt%, 83 wt%, 84 wt%, 85 wt%, 86 wt%, 87 wt% or 88 wt% or so. The ratio may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0185]    When the resin composition is a one-component resin composition, the content of the filler component may be a ratio based on the total weight of the relevant resin composition, and in the case of a two-component resin composition, it may be a ratio based on the combined weight of the main part and the curing agent part of the two-component resin composition, or may be a ratio based on the total weight of the main part or the curing agent part alone. ;[0186]    When the resin composition is composed of the two-component resin composition, it may be appropriate that the filler component to be applied to the final cured body as the filler component is divided in substantially equal amounts and introduced into the main and curing agent parts, respectively. ;[0187]    The filler component may comprise various types of fillers, if necessary, in addition to the thermally conductive filler, and for example, a carbon filler such as graphite, fumed silica, or clay, and the like may be applied. ;[0188]    The resin composition may further comprise necessary components in addition to the above-described components. ;[0189]    In one example, the resin composition may further comprise a plasticizer. As described above, in the present application, it is possible to secure low adhesion force to a specific material without applying a plasticizer, but a small amount of plasticizer may also be applied if necessary. ;[0190]    The type of the applicable plasticizer is not particularly limited, and for example, a phthalate-based plasticizer such as dioctyl phthalate (DOP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP), diisononyl phthalate (DINP) or polyethylene terephthalate (PET), an adipate-based plasticizer such as dioctyl adipate (DOA) or diisononyl adipate (DINA), a fatty acid-based plasticizer, a phosphoric acid-based plasticizer, or a polyester-based plasticizer, and the like may be applied. ;[0191]    When the plasticizer is included, the ratio may be adjusted according to the purpose. For example, when the plasticizer is included, the lower limit of the weight ratio of the plasticizer relative to 100 parts by weight of the oil-modified polyol compound may be 0.5 parts by weight, 1.5 parts by weight, 2 parts by weight, 3 parts by weight, 4 parts by weight, 5 parts by weight, 6 parts by weight, 7 parts by weight, 8 parts by weight, 9 parts by weight, 10 parts by weight, 15 parts by weight, 20 parts by weight, 25 parts by weight, 30 parts by weight, 35 parts by weight, 40 parts by weight, 45 parts by weight, 50 parts by weight, 100 parts by weight, 150 parts by weight, 200 parts by weight, 250 parts by weight or 300 parts by weight or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 500 parts by weight, 450 parts by weight, 400 parts by weight, 350 parts by weight, 300 parts by weight, 250 parts by weight, 200 parts by weight, 150 parts by weight, 100 parts by weight, 90 parts by weight, 80 parts by weight, 70 parts by weight, 60 parts by weight, 50 parts by weight, 40 parts by weight, 30 parts by weight, 20 parts by weight, 19 parts by weight, 18 parts by weight, 17 parts by weight, 16 parts by weight, 15 parts by weight, 14 parts by weight, 13 parts by weight, 12 parts by weight, 11 parts by weight, 10 parts by weight, 9 parts by weight, 8 parts by weight, 7 parts by weight, 6 parts by weight, 5 parts by weight, 4 parts by weight, 3 parts by weight, 2 parts by weight or 1 part by weight or so. The ratio may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0192]    In another example, when the plasticizer is included, the lower limit of the ratio of the plasticizer relative to 100 parts by weight of the sum (oil-modified component) of the oil-modified polyol and the oil-modified alcohol may be 0.5 parts by weight, 1.5 parts by weight, 2 parts by weight, 5 parts by weight, 10 parts by weight, 15 parts by weight, 20 parts by weight, 25 parts by weight, 30 parts by weight, 50 parts by weight, 60 parts by weight, 70 parts by weight, 80 parts by weight, 90 parts by weight, 100 parts by weight, 110 parts by weight, 120 parts by weight, 130 parts by weight or 140 parts by weight or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 400 parts by weight, 350 parts by weight, 300 parts by weight, 250 parts by weight, 200 parts by weight, 150 parts by weight, 100 parts by weight, 90 parts by weight, 80 parts by weight, 70 parts by weight, 60 parts by weight, 50 parts by weight, 40 parts by weight, 30 parts by weight, 20 parts by weight, 19 parts by weight, 18 parts by weight, 17 parts by weight, 16 parts by weight, 15 parts by weight, 14 parts by weight, 13 parts by weight, 12 parts by weight, 11 parts by weight, 10 parts by weight, 9 parts by weight, 8 parts by weight, 7 parts by weight, 6 parts by weight, 5 parts by weight, 4 parts by weight, 3 parts by weight, 2 parts by weight or 1 part by weight or so. The ratio may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0193]    The ratio may also be changed in consideration of the composition or intended use of the entire resin composition. ;[0194]    In addition to the above components, the resin composition may comprise additional components as needed. It may further comprise, as an example of additional components, a catalyst that assists or accelerates the curing reaction, a viscosity modifier (e.g., thixotropy imparting agent, diluent, etc.) for increasing or decreasing the viscosity, or for adjusting the viscosity according to shear force, a dispersing agent, a surface treatment agent, or a coupling agent, and the like. ;[0195]    The resin composition may further include a flame retardant or a flame-retardant adjuvant. In this case, a known flame retardant may be used without special limitation, and for example, a solid filler type flame retardant or a liquid flame retardant may be applied. ;[0196]    The flame retardant includes, for example, an organic flame retardant such as melamine cyanurate or an inorganic flame retardant such as magnesium hydroxide, and the like. When the amount of filler filled in the resin layer is large, a liquid type flame retardant material (TEP, triethyl phosphate, or TCPP, tris(1,3-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate, etc.) may also be used. In addition, a silane coupling agent capable of acting as a flame-retardant synergist may also be added. ;[0197]    As described above, the resin composition may be the one-component composition or the two-component composition. In the case of the two-component composition, the above-described respective components of the resin composition may be separately included in the main part and the curing agent part which are physically separated. ;[0198]    In one example, the present application relates to a composition (two-component composition) in which the resin composition is composed of a two-component resin composition. ;[0199]    Such a two-component composition may comprise at least a main part and a curing agent part, where the main and curing agent parts may be physically separated from each other. When the main and curing agent parts thus physically separated are mixed, a curing reaction may be initiated, and as a result, polyurethane may be formed. ;[0200]    In the two-component composition, the main part may comprise at least the hydroxy functional component (particularly, the oil-modified polyol compound), and the curing agent part may comprise at least the polyisocyanate. ;[0201]    When the general polyol compound as described above is included in the resin composition, this compound may be included, for example, in the main part. ;[0202]    In addition, the filler component may be included in any one of the main and curing agent parts, or may be included in both the main and curing agent parts. When the filler component is included in both the main and curing agent parts, the same amount of the filler component may be included in the main and curing agent parts. ;[0203]    The catalyst, plasticizer, flame retardants, and the like as other components may be included in the main and/or curing agent part as needed. ;[0204]    Furthermore, in the two-component composition, a volume ratio (P/N) of the volume (P) of the main part to the volume (N) of the curing agent part may be in a range of about 0.8 to 1.2. ;[0205]    Such a two-component composition or the cured body thereof may also exhibit the adhesion force to aluminum and polyester, thermal conductivity, hardness, curvature radius, insulation, flame retardancy, specific gravity, shrinkage, coefficient of thermal expansion and/or 5% weight loss temperature in a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and the like. ;[0206]    The present application also relates to a product comprising the resin composition or the cured body thereof. The resin composition of the present application or the cured body thereof may be usefully applied as a heat dissipation material. Therefore, the product may comprise a heat-generating component. The term heat-generating component means a component that emits heat during use, and the type is not particularly limited. The representative heat-generating component includes various electric/electronic products comprising battery cells, battery modules, or battery packs, and the like. ;[0207]    The product of the present application may comprise, for example, the heat-generating component and the resin composition (or the two-component composition) or the cured body thereof existing adjacent to the heat-generating component. ;[0208]    A specific method of configuring the product of the present application is not particularly limited, and if the resin composition or the two-component composition of the present application, or the cured body thereof is applied as a heat dissipation material, the product may be configured in various known ways. ;Advantageous Effects;[0209]    In the present application, it is possible to provide a resin composition or a cured body thereof that exhibits low adhesion force to a predetermined adherend while exhibiting high thermal conductivity. Also, in the present application, the low adhesion force can be achieved without using an adhesion force adjusting component such as a plasticizer or in a state where the use ratio thereof is minimized. The present application can also provide a product comprising the curable composition or the cured body thereof. ;Description of Drawings;[0210]    Figures 1  and  2  are analysis results for oil-modified components obtained in Preparation Examples. ;Best Mode;[0211]    Hereinafter, the present application will be specifically described through Examples, but the scope of the present application is not limited by the following examples. ;[0212]    The cured body mentioned below is formed by mixing main and curing agent parts of all resin compositions in Examples, which are prepared in a two-component type, so that the OH/NCO equivalent ratio described in each example is satisfied, and then maintaining the mixture at room temperature for about 24 hours. ;1. Thermal conductivity;[0213]    The thermal conductivity of the resin composition or the cured body thereof was measured by a hot-disk method according to ISO 22007-2 standard. Specifically, mixtures of the main parts and the curing agent parts in a volume ratio of 1:1 in Examples or Comparative Examples composed of a two-component type were each placed in a mold having a thickness of about 7 mm or so, and the thermal conductivity was measured in the through plane direction using the Hot Disk equipment. As stipulated in the above standard (ISO 22007-2), the Hot Disk equipment is an equipment that can check the thermal conductivity by measuring the temperature change (electrical resistance change) while the sensor with the nickel wire double spiral structure is heated, and the thermal conductivity was measured according to this standard. ;2. Measurement of adhesion force to polyester;[0214]    The adhesion force to polyester was evaluated for a specimen prepared by attaching a PET (polyethylene terephthalate) film and an aluminum plate. A film having a width of 10 mm or so and a length of 200 mm or so was used as the PET film, and an aluminum plate having each of a width and a length of 100 mm was used as the aluminum plate. A resin composition was applied to the entire surface of the aluminum plate and maintained at room temperature (about 25°C) for about 24 hours in a state where the PET film was attached on the resin composition to prepare a specimen. At this time, the entire width and 100 mm or so of the length portion in the PET film were attached to the aluminum plate via the resin composition. The adhesion force was measured while the PET film was peeled from the aluminum plate in the longitudinal direction in a state where the aluminum plate of the specimen was fixed. The attachment was performed by applying the resin composition (the mixture of the main part and the curing agent part in a volume ratio of 1:1) to the aluminum plate to have a thickness of about 2 mm or so after curing, and then closely attaching the PET film on the layer of the resin composition, and maintaining them at room temperature (about 25°C) for about 24 hours to cure the resin composition. The peeling was performed at a peel rate of about 0.5 mm/min or so and a peel angle of 180 degrees until the PET film was completely peeled off. ;3. Measurement of adhesion force to aluminum;[0215]    An uncured resin composition (a mixture of a main part and a curing agent part) was coated in the center of an aluminum substrate having horizontal and vertical lengths of 2 cm and 7 cm, respectively, to have a width of 2 cm and a length of 2 cm or so, and an aluminum substrate having horizontal and vertical lengths of 2 cm and 7 cm, respectively, was attached again on the coating layer, and the resin composition was cured by maintaining the state. Here, the two aluminum substrates were attached to form an angle of 90 degrees to each other. Hereinafter, with the upper aluminum substrate fixed, the lower aluminum substrate was pressed at a speed of 0.5 mm/min to measure the force while the lower aluminum substrate was separated, and the adhesion force to aluminum was obtained by dividing the maximum force measured in the process by the area of the specimen. ;[0216]    According to the measurement results, the adhesion force to aluminum was evaluated by the following criteria. ;<Evaluation criteria>;[0217]    \nGood: The adhesion force to aluminum is 0.1 N/mm<2> or less\nAverage: The adhesion force to aluminum is more than 0.1 N/mm<2> and 0.4 N/mm<2> or less\nBad: The adhesion force to aluminum exceeds 0.4 N/mm<2>;4. Hardness measurement;[0218]    The hardness of the cured body of the resin composition was measured according to ASTM D 2240 and JIS K 6253 standards. It was performed using ASKER's durometer hardness device, where the initial hardness was measured by applying a load of 1 Kg or more (about 1.5 Kg) to the surface of the sample (resin layer) in a flat state, and after 15 seconds, the hardness was evaluated by confirming the stabilized measurement value. ;5. Measurement of curvature radius;[0219]    The curvature radius of the cured body was evaluated using a cured body having a width, a length, and a thickness of 1cm, 10cm, and 2mm, respectively. When the cured body is attached to cylinders having various radii and bent along the longitudinal direction, the curvature radius is the minimum radius of the cylinder at which cracks do not occur in the cured body. ;6. Measurement of weight average molecular weight;[0220]    The weight average molecular weight (Mw) was measured using GPC (Gel permeation chromatography). Specifically, the weight average molecular weight (Mw) can be measured by adding a sample to be analyzed into a 5 mL vial, diluting it with a THF (tetrahydrofuran) solvent to a concentration of about 1 mg/mL, and then filtering a standard sample for calibration and the analysis sample through a syringe filter (pore size: 0.45 µm). Agilent technologies' ChemStation is used as an analysis program, and the weight average molecular weight (Mw) can be obtained by comparing the elution time of the sample with the calibration curve. ;[0221]    <GPC measurement conditions>\nInstrument: Agilent technologies' 1200 series\nColumn: using Agilent technologies' TL Mix.

A catalyst (tin (II) 2-ethylhexanoate (Sigma-Aldrich)) was added to the mixture in an amount of about 0.5 parts by weight relative to 100 parts by weight of the total, and stirred and maintained at 150°C for 30 minutes under an inert gas purge condition. Subsequently, a small amount of xylene as an azeotropic solution was introduced thereto, the temperature was raised to 190°C, and the mixture was reacted for 15 hours or more, and the pressure was reduced to 40 Torr or less for 2 hours or more to remove xylene and unreacted substances. The reactant was cooled, and then filtered through a filter to obtain the target product. ;[0224]    From GPC analysis results of the obtained target product, it could be confirmed that the oil-modified polyols of Formulas A and B above were present in the target product in a weight ratio of about 1:2 (A: B). ;[0225]    The weight average molecular weight of the target product confirmed through GPC analysis was about 1307 g/mol. ;Preparation Example 1B.;[0226]    A target product was synthesized in the same manner as in Preparation Example 1B, except that when mixing trimethylolpropane and linoleic acid as an unsaturated fatty acid, the weight ratio (trimethylolpropane: linoleic acid) was about 1:3.34. ;[0227]    From GPC analysis results of the obtained target product, it could be confirmed that the oil-modified polyols of Formulas A and B above were present in the target product in a weight ratio of about 1:1.5 (A: B). ;[0228]    The weight average molecular weight of the target product confirmed through GPC analysis was about 1268 g/mol. ;Preparation Example 1C.;[0229]    A target product was synthesized in the same manner as in Preparation Example 1B, except that when mixing trimethylolpropane and linoleic acid as an unsaturated fatty acid, the weight ratio (trimethylolpropane: linoleic acid) was about 1:3.14. ;[0230]    From GPC analysis results of the obtained target product, it could be confirmed that the oil-modified polyols of Formulas A and B above were present in the target product in a weight ratio of about 1: 1 (A: B). ;[0231]    The weight average molecular weight of the target product confirmed through GPC analysis was about 1210 g/mol. ;Preparation Example 1D.;[0232]    A target product was synthesized in the same manner as in Preparation Example 1B, except that when mixing trimethylolpropane and linoleic acid as an unsaturated fatty acid, the weight ratio (trimethylolpropane: linoleic acid) was about 1:2.79. ;[0233]    From GPC analysis results of the obtained target product, it could be confirmed that the oil-modified polyols of Formulas A and B above were present in the target product in a weight ratio of about 2:1 (A: B). ;[0234]    The weight average molecular weight of the target product confirmed through GPC analysis was about 1113 g/mol. ;[0235]    Figure 1  is GPC analysis results for Preparation Example 1D above. ;Preparation Example 2.;[0236]    A mixture of an oil-modified polyol represented by the following formula C and an oil-modified alcohol represented by Formula D was prepared in the following manner.\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8c8f92b9-616d-46b7-9113-89d48615c068-ib0015\" />;\n[0237]    In Formula C, each n is about 4, R1 is a substituent of the following formula C-1, and R2 is a substituent of the following formula C-2.\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8c8f92b9-616d-46b7-9113-89d48615c068-ib0016\" />;\n[0238]    In Formula D, each n is about 4, R1 is a substituent of Formula C-1 below, and R2 is a substituent of Formula C-2 below.\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8c8f92b9-616d-46b7-9113-89d48615c068-ib0017\" />;\n[0239]    In Formula C-1, n is about 4.\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8c8f92b9-616d-46b7-9113-89d48615c068-ib0018\" />;\n[0240]    In Formula C-2, the symbol * means that the relevant site is connected to Formula C or D.", "sdg": "None"}

The use of such adhesive prevented minor delamination and was viable for 10 attempted uses in a subsequent trial. The enclosure gave weight to the device and prevented errant movement with patient volatility, and delamination was minimized by sizing the enclosure to be larger than the area covered by the adhesive treated sensor.\n<tb>Motion artifact<SEP>Normal and abnormal patient movement in an initial study resulted in aberrations in captured heat data.<SEP>AFC cables present a likely source of motion related noise. The wireless iteration of the device combined with subtraction algorithms and a narrowed accepted data range (given the obtained sample and future data) have and will continue to refine and eliminate this artifact.\n<tb>Ease of handling<SEP>The initial trial saw a great deal of difficulty in device handling for the surgeon. Due to the adhesive involved, manipulation with gloved fingers was difficult. Excess traction put on the device and its elements led to poor performance both in terms of lamination and noise artifact engendered.<SEP>The device enclosure ideated resulted in a PDMS device frame designed to aid handling by the diagnostician. This not only reduced glove related device manipulation but facilitated swift application minimizing patient discomfort. Devices were more robust and performed admirably through periods of over 10 trials.\n<tb>Alignment<SEP>Precise alignment of the sensor to the skin overlying tunneled distal shunt catheter was occasionally difficult when attempting to approximate its center.<SEP>Winged attachments and central lines on the enclosure were designed on subsequent device iterations. These improved most applications from multiple attempts at placement to initial success in all subsequent trials. The winged attachments also had an unintended benefit to device handling.\n<tb>Vasculature<SEP>Patients with prominent clavicular veins and superficial arterial branches adjacent to underlying shunt tubing were suspected of possible contamination.<SEP>Benchtop experiments simulated flow rates in shunts, venous and arterial systems with varying flow experiments were conducted with a fluid injector into multiple caliber tubes.\n<tb>Skin thickness<SEP>The depth of tunneled distal shunt catheters was suspected to differ among patients with varying habituses.<SEP>Benchtop experiments, radiographic data and the academic literature were consulted in the resolution of this important question. Anecdotally, over 10 surgeons stated that based on feel and experience alone, shunt catheters were likely 1-8 mm under the skin. Further experiments demonstrated sensor performance to a depth of 6 mm. Measurements shunt catheter to surface distance of available computerized tomography scans of patients was also performed, with an average total thickness of subcutaneous tissue overlying the distal catheter of 1.52 mm. Finally, a comprehensive literature search was performed. Established factors including total soft tissue to bony protuberance distance to skin (under 2 mm),", "sdg": "SDG3"}

In China, every year more than 500 thousand patients wait for liver transplantation while several hundreds to about one thousand liver sources can be used for liver transplantation. The limited number of liver sources is far from meeting a huge and urgent clinical requirement. Existing clinical treatments and preclinical researches have shown that both bioartificial liver dialysis and hepatocyte transplantation contribute to the improvement of livers and general microenvironments and physiological conditions and contribute to liver repair and the recovery of liver functions. This might salvage toxic acute liver failure and, more importantly, can delay or prevent the progression of some patients with advanced liver diseases into end-stage liver failure. Both treatments require a large number of hepatocytes. Human primary hepatocytes are ideal seed cells and mainly obtained from livers that are not suitable for liver transplantation.

{"patent_number": "EP4279132A2", "description_number": 6, "description_text": "The management of patients with migraine is often unsatisfactory because available acute and preventive therapies are either ineffective or poorly tolerated. The acute treatment of migraine attacks has been limited to the use of analgesics, combinations of analgesics with caffeine, ergotamines, and the triptans. Despite the availability of certain preventive medications for migraine, many patients do not respond to these treatments or are unable to tolerate them. (For a description of such agents see e.g.  New Therapeutic Approaches for the Prevention and Treatment of Migraine, Diener, H.C. et al., (2015) Lancet Neurology, 14:1010-22 ). In countries like the United States, Germany, France, and Japan, approximately 43% of patients have experienced a failure of their preventive medication or have switched treatments. Among patients with episodic or chronic migraine who are undergoing oral preventative treatment, side effects and a lack of efficacy are the most common reasons for discontinuing their treatment. Prior treatments of migraine may leave significant numbers of patients without adequate treatment. For instance, up to 40% of migraine attacks, ~30% of patients, fail to respond to a particular triptan, because of suboptimal efficacy or tolerability issues (See  Dodick DW. Headache. 2005;45:156-162 , and  Tepper DE. Headache. 2013(53)577-578 ). Because of their vasoconstricting effects, these medications may have contraindications, warnings, and precautions for patients with cardiovascular risk factors and disease (See  Alwhaibi M, et al. Pain Res Treat. 2016; 2016:8538101 , and  Gilmore B, Michael M. Am Fam Physician. 2011(83)271-280 ). Thus, for prior monotherapy or dual therapy migraine prevention and/or treatments, a substantial fraction of patients may fail to achieve headache relief and/or freedom from pain in response to treatment or preventative therapy. Further, some patients, referred to herein as therapy resistant migraine patients, will fail to successfully manage their migraine attacks and will suffer from migraines which are refractory to two or more prior monotherapy and/or dual therapy prevention or treatment regimens. These inadequately controlled migraine patients may have a number of migraine days per-month that continues to be significantly disabling.", "sdg": "SDG3"}

{"patent_number": "EP3872093A1", "description_number": 3, "description_text": "With the development of tumor molecular biology, the targeted drugs and immunotherapy are confirmed to have efficacy in treatment of hematoma, breast cancer and colorectal cancer, but their application in gastric cancer treatment is relatively halted. At present, the internationally approved targets for gastric cancer targeted therapy include human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the approved gastric cancer immunotherapy target is programmed lethal protein 1 (PD-1). In September 2017, based on the large-scale phase III clinical trial of ATTRACTION-2, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan approved the PD-1 antibody Opdivo for the treatment of patients with chemotherapy-resistant advanced gastric cancer: as compared with placebo, Opdivo could reduce the mortality rate by 37% and showed an effective rate of 11.2%. Based on the phase II clinical trial of Keynote 059, the US FDA has accelerated the approval of using PD-1 antibody Keytruda in treatment of chemotherapy-resistant PD-L1-positive advanced gastric cancer patients, showing an effective rate of 15.5%. In terms of targeted therapy, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) not only promotes tumor angiogenesis, but also binds to receptors on the surface of tumor cells to activate downstream signaling pathways and directly participates in the formation, occurrence and migration of tumor stem cells. Both the VEGFR2 inhibitors apatinib and ramucirumab have been clinically confirmed to be safe and effective for VEFR-targeted therapy of advanced gastric cancer of second-line and above. HER2 gene amplification or protein overexpression occurs in about 6% to 35% of new cases of gastric cancer each year, thus HER2 is one of the important targets in anticancer treatment. The TOGA phase III clinical trial first demonstrated the advantages of trastuzumab in the first-line treatment of HER2 (+) advanced gastric cancer, and the OS of the group treated with trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy was significantly longer than that of the group treated with chemotherapy alone (13.8 months vs. 11 Months), and the secondary endpoints including PFS, ORR (objective response rate) and TTP (time to progression) were also improved significantly. However, the proportion of HER2-positive patients in China is only about 10%, therefore it is imperative to explore new therapeutic targets for gastric cancer.", "sdg": "SDG3"}

{"patent_number": "EP3828199A1", "description_number": 191, "description_text": "In certain aspects, an ALK7:ActRIIB antagonist antibody, or combination of antibodies, is an antibody that inhibits at least activin (activin A, activin B, activin C, activin E, activin AB, activin AC, activin AE, activin BC and/or activin BE). Therefore, in some embodiments, an ALK7:ActRIIB antagonist antibody, or combination of antibodies, binds to at least activin (activin A, activin B, activin C, activin E, activin AB, activin AC, activin AE, activin BC and/or activin BE). As used herein, an activin antibody (or anti-activin antibody) generally refers to an antibody that can bind to a form of activin with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful as a diagnostic and/or therapeutic agent in targeting that form of activin. In certain embodiments, the extent of binding of an activin antibody to an unrelated, non-activin protein is less than about 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, or less than about 1% of the binding of the antibody to activin as measured, for example, by a radioimmunoassay (RIA), Biacore, or other protein interaction or binding affinity assay. In certain embodiments, an activin antibody binds to an epitope of activin that is conserved among activin from different species. In certain preferred embodiments, an anti-activin antibody binds to human activin. In other preferred embodiments, a activin antibody may inhibit activin from binding to a type I and/or type II receptor (e.g., ActRIIB and/or ALK7) and thus inhibit activin-mediated signaling (e.g., Smad signaling).

{"patent_number": "EP4240113A1", "description_number": 25, "description_text": "Further referring to  FIG. 3 ,  FIG. 4 ,  FIG. 5  and  FIG. 6 , the load is connected between the output terminal L_LOAD and the N line, when an overcurrent or short circuit occurs, the large current flows through the fuse F1, the primary side of the current transformer CT1, the field effect transistor Q1, the field effect transistor Q2, the load and the cable, etc., and then returns to the N line to form the entire circuit. When a large current flows through the primary side of the current transformer CT1, its secondary side coil will induce a current signal of equal proportion (actually 1000: 1), applying to the detection resistors R50 and R51, the greater the current, the voltage on the detection resistor (ISEN signal) will increase proportionally, the ISEN signal passes through the electronic rectifier composed of rectifier U7A and rectifier U7C (similar to the effect of rectifier diode, the advantage of electronic rectification is that there is no offset loss of PN junction, and the waveform is not distorted), the steamed bun wave of DC component is output at the 8th pin of the rectifier U7C, and then through the resistor R36, it is input to the positive input port of the comparator U7D (Pin 12 in the figures), and compared with the reference voltage of the negative input port (Pin 13 in the figures), if the voltage exceeds 2.667V, then the output port (Pin 14 in the figures) will output a high level, the base of the transistor Q7 is positively biased through the resistor R38, the collector and the emitter of the transistor Q7 are turned on, the base of the transistor Q8 becomes low level, the collector and the emitter of the transistor Q8 are turned on, the high level is added to the base of the transistor Q7 through the resistor R40, forcing the collector and the emitter of the transistor Q7 to continue to conduct; the collector of the transistor Q7 quickly pulls down the base of the transistor Q3 through the diode D8, the collector and emitter of the transistor Q3 are turned off, the collector and the emitter of the transistor Q4 are turned on, and the second and third pins of the driving optocoupler M1 are short-circuited. The 6th and 7th pins of the driving optocoupler M1 output a low level, and the gate voltages of the field effect transistor Q1 and the field effect transistor Q2 are low level, the drain and source of field effect transistor Q1 are cut off, the drain and source of field effect transistor Q2 are cut off, the output current is cut off, and the field effect transistor Q1 and field effect transistor Q2 are protected in time. The risk of damage due to overheating due to high current is avoided. However, in the actual circuit, due to the existence of the parasitic inductance and capacitive reactance of the cable at the load end (the LED drive power has input capacitance), at the moment when the large current is disconnected, the parasitic inductance will generate a back electromotive force, forming a voltage spike, which is superimposed on the drain and source ends of the field effect transistor Q1 and the drain and source ends of the field effect transistor Q2. At this time, the rectifier bridge stack BD2 will rectify this voltage spike and then charge the capacitor C37. Microscopically, the two ends of the capacitor are equivalent to a constant voltage source. Using the principle that the voltage across the large capacitor cannot change abruptly, during the charging process, the rising slope of the spike voltage is forced to become slow, and the high spike voltage is suppressed to break down the main power MOS transistor field effect transistor Q1 and field effect transistor Q2. Resistor R74 and resistor R78 discharge the capacitor C37, and at the same time connect the transient suppression diode TVS tube in parallel at both ends of the capacitor C37 (the voltage-stabilizing diode D2, voltage-stabilizing diode D4 and voltage-stabilizing diode D7 are connected in series), to prevent the load power and capacitive reactance from being too large, and to avoid the generated back electromotive force energy being larger, the voltage on the capacitor C37 will be higher. When the avalanche voltage of the TVS tube (i.e. voltage-stabilizing diode D2, voltage-stabilizing diode D4 and voltage-stabilizing diode D7) is exceeded, it will turn on and absorb the spike current and enter the clamping state. The clamping voltage is below the withstand voltage of field effect transistor Q 1 and field effect transistor Q2 of 650V, which realizes double protection of the main power transistor (i.e. field effect transistor Q1 and field effect transistor Q2). The other way of the collector of the transistor Q7 pulls down the third pin of the main control chip U200 through the diode D9, after the software program makes a judgment, it quickly enters the protection, forcing the first pin of the main control chip U200 to stop outputting the PWM waveform, which also stops the output of the dimmer, and the dimmer stops. After that, the program delays for one minute, restarts the work automatically, and outputs a high level of 2ms from the 48th pin of the main control chip U200, so that the collector and emitter of the transistor Q9 are turned on, and the base of the transistor Q7 is pulled down. The collector of the transistor Q7 becomes a high level, the collector and the emitter of the transistor Q8 are turned off, forming an unlock, and the dimmer can achieve dimming normally; if the short circuit is not removed, the BRCT clamping and absorbing circuit with short-circuit protection will continue to protect again, and so on, until the short-circuit is removed, the dimmer automatically resumes normal operation and can achieve dimming.", "sdg": "SDG9"}

Mikiciński and P. Sobiczewski, and published in Progress in Plant Protection (2018), Volume 58, Issue 1, pages 68-75, the protection of plants against fire blight involves the integration of various methods aimed at preventing infection and managing the disease. Among chemical plant protection agents, copper-based preparations are almost exclusively registered for combatting fire blight in Poland. However, various limitations associated with their use have driven an increased interest in alternative methods, including biological approaches involving bacteria. The publication highlights that naturally occurring bacteria with antagonistic effects against the causative agent of fire blight have been identified in natural conditions. These bacteria possess the ability to protect plants from the disease. Research conducted in various countries has shown that the most effective species for biological control include Pantoea agglomerans, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus subtilis, and Lactobacillus plantarum. Extensive research on the application of various strains of P. agglomerans (formerly classified as Erwinia herbicola) for combating fire blight was conducted in the 1980s under the guidance of Professor S. V. Beer at Cornell University in New York state. This research is described in the publication:  S. V. Beer, J. R. Rundle, titled \"Suppression of Erwinia amylovora by Erwinia herbicola in immature pear fruits,\" published in Phytopathology (1983), Vol. 73, No. 9, pp. 1346-1346 .

Such modifications include, e.g., modifications remote from the FcRn contact sites as well as modifications within the contact sites that preserve or even enhance binding to the FcRn. For example the following single amino acid residues in human IgG1 Fc (Fcy1) can be substituted without significant loss of Fc binding affinity for FcRn: P238A, S239A, K246A, K248A, D249A, M252A, T256A, E258A, T260A, D265A, S267A, H268A, E269A, D270A, E272A, L274A, N276A, Y278A, D280A, V282A, E283A, H285A, N286A, T289A, K290A, R292A, E293A, E294A, Q295A, Y296F, N297A, S298A, Y300F, R301A, V303A, V305A, T307A, L309A, Q311A, D312A, N315A, K317A, E318A, K320A, K322A, S324A, K326A, A327Q, P329A, A330Q, A330S, P331A, P331S, E333A, K334A, T335A, S337A, K338A, K340A, Q342A, R344A, E345A, Q347A, R355A, E356A, M358A, T359A, K360A, N361A, Q362A, Y373A, S375A D376A, A378Q, E380A, E382A, S383A, N384A, Q386A, E388A, N389A, N390A, Y391F, K392A, L398A, S400A, D401A, D413A, K414A, R416A, Q418A, Q419A, N421A, V422A, S424A, E430A, N434A, T437A, Q438A, K439A, S440A, S444A, and K447A, where for example P238A represents wildtype proline substituted by alanine at position number 238. In addition to alanine other amino acids may be substituted for the wildtype amino acids at the positions specified above. Mutations may be introduced singly into Fc giving rise to more than one hundred FcRn binding partners distinct from native Fc. Additionally, combinations of two, three, or more of these individual mutations may be introduced together, giving rise to hundreds more FcRn binding partners. Certain of these mutations may confer new functionality upon the FcRn binding partner. For example, one embodiment incorporates N297A, removing a highly conserved N-glycosylation site. The effect of this mutation is to reduce immunogenicity, thereby enhancing circulating half-life of the FcRn binding partner, and to render the FcRn binding partner incapable of binding to FcyRI, FcyRIIA, FcyRIIB, and FcyRIIIA, without compromising affinity for FcRn ( Routledge et al. 1995, Transplantation 60:847 , which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety;  Friend et al. 1999, Transplantation 68:1632 , which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety;  Shields et al. 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591 , which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Additionally, at least three human Fc gamma receptors appear to recognize a binding site on IgG within the lower hinge region, generally amino acids 234-237. Therefore, another example of new functionality and potential decreased immunogenicity may arise from mutations of this region, as for example by replacing amino acids 233-236 of human IgG1 \"ELLG\" to the corresponding sequence from IgG2 \"PVA\" (with one amino acid deletion). It has been shown that FcyRI, FcyRII, and FcyRIII which mediate various effector functions will not bind to IgG1 when such mutations have been introduced ( Ward and Ghetie 1995, Therapeutic Immunology 2:77 , which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; and  Armour et al.1999, Eur. J. Immunol. 29:2613 , which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). As a further example of new functionality arising from mutations described above affinity for FcRn may be increased beyond that of wild type in some instances. This increased affinity may reflect an increased \"on\" rate, a decreased \"off\" rate or both an increased \"on\" rate and a decreased \"off\" rate. Mutations believed to impart an increased affinity for FcRn include, e.g., T256A, T307A, E380A, and N434A ( Shields et al. 2001, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591 , which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).", "sdg": "SDG3"}

{"patent_number": "EP3916976A1", "description_number": 4, "description_text": "With their negligible or non-existent reverse recovery loss, wide-bandgap devices have enabled more common use of the totem-pole configuration in AC-DC converters. In AC-DC converters, as the totem-pole DC output voltage is higher than the peak AC input voltage, the minimum voltage gain is limited to one. In applications where the input voltage is very low, controlled switches S1 and S2 must operate at an excessively high duty-cycle to regulate DC output voltage VO, which increases conduction losses and reduces circuit efficiency. Hence, there is a need for a PFC circuit with an extended voltage gain. Additionally, to operate totem-pole boost converter 100 of  Figure 1  in a bidirectional power-flow mode, diodes D1 and D2 of the half-bridge leg are replaced with controlled switches (i.e., synchronous rectifiers). Furthermore, some applications require a higher gain in the regulated DC output voltage, especially when the PFC circuit operates under a low AC input voltage. One way to achieve the extended voltage gain is illustrated in  Figure 2  by AC-DC boost converter 200, which exemplifies a half-bridge PFC topology. AC-DC boost converter 200 has the advantage that, at any given time, only one of switches S1 and S2 is in the input current path, which further reduces conduction losses. AC-DC boost converter 200 has another advantage in a low input voltage application in which the DC output voltage is at least twice the peak AC input voltage. In that application, AC-DC boost converter has a voltage-doubler characteristic not achievable in the totem-pole PFC topology. However, AC-DC boost converter 200 has a significant drawback in that its output capacitor is much larger than the output capacitor of either the totem-pole PFC circuit of  Figure 1  or a conventional boost PFC converter, as the output capacitors of AC-DC boost converter 200 charge during one half-cycle of the input line voltage and discharge during the other half-cycle. Long periods for charging and discharging require the output capacitors of AC-DC boost converter 200 to store significantly more energy in order to limit the fluctuations around its DC voltage.", "sdg": "SDG12"}

{"patent_number": "EP4425316A2", "description_number": 172, "description_text": "An example formula engine 6302 further pares a redundant aspect of the invalidation graph 6606 and/or a duplicative aspect of the invalidation graph 6606. For example, referencing  Figure 68 , an invalidation graph 6606 consistent with the dependency graph 6604 is depicted. The invalidation graph 6606 is organized with a first value in the first column, and values in a second column within the document 6406 that are no longer valid after the change in the first value. It can be seen that the relationships within the invalidation graph 6606 do not require tracing through the entire dependency graph 6604 in response to a change in a value, and can therefore enable more efficient updating of result values and/or the executable object 6502 than the use of the dependency graph 6604 alone. The organization of the invalidation graph 6606 is non-limiting, and any virtual conceptualization of invalidation checks for the document 6406 are contemplated herein. Referencing  Figure 68 , a pared invalidation graph 6606 removes certain redundant invalidation checks, yet still provides for sufficient invalidation checks according to the dependency graph 6604 of  Figure 67 . For example, a check of data value B in response to a change in data value A is redundant, as data value A affects data value B through the operation of formula A. [should we say somewhere here how this improves the functioning of the computer?] Therefore, a redundant check is eliminated in the pared invalidation graph 6606 depicted in  Figure 68 . Referencing  Figure 69 , yet another pared invalidation graph 6606 is depicted, removing certain duplicative checks still further relative to the pared invalidation graph 6606 of  Figure 68 . For example, although data value A invalidates data value D, that check is duplicative as data value A also invalidates data value B, which also invalidates data value D. Accordingly, the relationship between data value A and data value D is a duplicative check, which can be removed to save processor and recalculation time. It can be seen additionally that the order of calculations can affect the invalidation order and the operations. For example, if data value A is changed, and data value D is changed in response, then data value D will need to be recalculated again after the data value B is updated. Accordingly, the invalidation graph 6606 and recalculation order is selected, in certain embodiments, to reduce the number of invalidation checks and recalculation operations, such as by completing the recalculation of data value B before recalculating data value D. An example unified document surface application circuit 6216 further interprets a user edit value 6602, and formula engine 6302 further updates the executable object 6502 and/or recalculates result values in response to the user edit value 6602 and the pared invalidation graph 6606.", "sdg": "SDG12"}
