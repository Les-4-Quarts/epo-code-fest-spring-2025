Such pipes are conventionally used for indoor (waste) water management, for example to connect sink drains, bathtub drains, shower drains, and other drains to the sewage system. In order to connect a drainage point to the sewer system while making optimal use of the available space and limitations, such pipes are typically assembled on-site using various fittings and connections to provide a pipe assembly which is unique to the house or building being fitted with the pipe assembly. Once assembled, it is important that the pipes are fixedly connected, such that vibrations and/or strain exerted on the piping system do not lead to defects. Today, the most commonly employed method to fixedly connect plastic pipes is still using glue to fix pipes to a pipe coupling. Glue has several disadvantages. For example, it is not environmentally friendly, it does not allow adjustments to be made after the glue has set, it often is applied incorrectly due to lack of knowledge about the pipe material and glue compatibilities, etc.", "true_sdg": "SDG12", "sdg_balise": "SDG 9, SDG 12", "reason_balise": "The text discusses an invention related to a pipe coupling for plastic pipes used in sewage drainage systems.

PROMIS<\u00ae> is part of a National Institutes of Health Roadmap initiative. Its stated goal is \"to provide clinicians and researchers access to efficient, precise, valid, and responsive adult- and child-reported measures of health and well-being\" (HealthMeasures 2013). The PROMIS initiative used modern measurement theory and a scientifically rigorous approach for instrument development involving quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods. This approach yielded patient self-report item banks with excellent psychometric properties. The PROMIS-SD (HealthMeasures WWW) patient self-report item bank was developed through an iterative process of literature searches, collecting and sorting items, expert content review, qualitative patient research, and pilot testing. The resulting 27 items assess self-reported perceptions of sleep quality, sleep depth, and restoration associated with sleep. This includes perceived difficulties and concerns with getting to sleep or staying asleep, as well as perceptions of the adequacy of, and satisfaction with, sleep. The PROMIS-SD has demonstrated excellent measurement properties including internal consistency and convergent validity. Validity of the item bank was supported by moderate to high correlations with existing scales and by the ability to distinguish among those with and without sleep disorders (Buysse et al 2010). The PROMIS-SD has been tested and exhibited validity evidence (e.g., expected associations, discrimination among known groups) in a wide range of populations (Busse et al 2013, Cook et al 2012, Fenton et al 2011, Stachler et al 2014). Subsequent research using item analyses and clinical judgement reduced the 27-item scale to 8 items. The authors reported the 8-item version to have \"greater measurement precision than the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)\" (Yu et al 2012). Further item reduction produced a 4-item version (PROMIS-SF SD 4a). The resulting 4 items measure sleep quality, sleep initiation, problems with sleep, and restfulness. Research conducted by Jensen et al (2016) demonstrated the 4-item version to have adequate reliability and validity. Each question has 5 response options ranging in value from 1 to 5. For scoring, the total raw score is found by summing the values of the response to each question. With the total raw score calculated, the applicable score conversion table is used in PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Scoring Manual to translate the total raw score into a T-score for each participant.

This, however, comes with a huge disadvantage insofar as HFC-152a has enormous Global Warming Potential (GWP) when compared to the usual hydrocarbon propellants. GWP is a well-known parameter that describes the impact of a greenhouse gas on global heating; a higher the GWP, the more a particular gas will contribute to global warming, the lower the GWP number, the more environmentally friendly is the gas. This hydrofluorocarbon option is further complicated by recent regulation on the amount of HFC-152a that can be produced and consumed in the US by The American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act which has been enacted by Congress and looks to reduce the production of HFC-152a by 40% and ultimately by 85%, which means there will be an increase the demand and price of HFC 152a as supply dwindles. An example of an environmentally-friendly solvent is water, which would reduce VOC content, but is typically not considered for use as a solvent for dry shampoo sprays for two major reasons: water does not feel dry on the hair when compared to a volatile solvent like ethanol; and it makes the powders clump and stick together which hinders dispensing as well as performance.

The multi-step process is thought to underlie a number of different neurologic conditions. The disease specific proteins undergo a specific biochemical modification which makes them prone to join and form globular intermediates (known as oligomers). These oligomers are thought to be toxic and can continue to build on one another forming protofibrils and fibrils. The fibrils may then be isolated into an intracellular inclusion (e.g. tau tangles) or an extracellular deposit (e.g. A\u03b2 plaque) in the case of Alzheimer's disease.\nFigure 6A  illustrates a schematic of the ventricular, spinal and ventriculo-spinal approaches for accessing the CSF space for the efficient turnover of conditioned CSF.  Figure 6B  illustrates one embodiment of the dual- and single- ventricular approaches of the invention.  Figure 6C  illustrates one embodiment of the spinal approach of the invention.\nFigure 7  illustrates a schematic of a single lumen system. A single-lumen system creates a local eddy (shading) with minimal mixing or access to cranial CSF.\nFigure 8A  illustrates a schematic of a dual lumen system of the invention. A multi-lumen system creates an active and dynamic flow with efficient mixing that is not limited by pressure volume as inflow and outflow are relatively equal. This allows for parallel processing of CSF with maximum turnover and provides access to the cranial and spinal space and entire CSF volume (mixing represented by shading).  Figure 8B  illustrates the dramatic difference in CSF clearance produced with a multilumen system in which inflow and outflow are substantially apart (line D), adjacent (line C) compared to a single lumen system (line B) compared to diffusion-limited flow (line A).  Figure 8C  illustrates the effect of catheter inflow/outflow distance on the rate of reprocessing of conditioned CSF.\nFigure 9A and 9B  illustrates cross-sections of sample dual or multilumen catheters, respectively, for use in the CSF space. These are but two examples of many embodiments that may be envisioned to achieve one of the ultimate goals of the invention which is a method to provide efficient mixing and turnover of CSF.\nFigure 10  illustrates catheters with helical out flow paths which induce additional mixing at various outflow points.  Figure 10A  illustrates a single helical outflow path over last length (1) of catheter. A straight outflow lumen connects to the helical path. The catheter comprises a straight central inflow lumen.  Figure 10B  illustrates a dual helical outflow path catheter with central inflow path.\nFigure 11A  illustrates dual helical outflow paths exiting at different points along the catheter. The catheter comprises a single central inflow path. As described herein, the paths can be reversed, for example, by a pump mechanism. Therefore, a catheter with a single inflow path and multiple outflow paths could become a single outflow path with multiple inflow paths.  Figure 11B  illustrates how helical path directional changes as another means of creating a directed flow.\nFigure 12A  illustrates two catheters bound by a double collar. The collar is fixed to one catheter and slips on other such that the distance \"d\" between the two ends is adjustable. In this case, the inflow catheter is interfaced with the slipping portion of the collar.  Figure 12B  illustrates a dual lumen catheter that is encircled by a tight fitting thin walled cannula. The outflow lumen of the inner catheter has side ports such that, as the cannula is pulled back additional side ports or openings are exposed, thereby increasing the distance between the inflow and outflow.\nFigure 13A  illustrates a dual lumen catheter with addressable holes on one lumen.  Figure 13B  illustrates a two catheter system creating a dual lumen catheter. As shown, the outflow catheter is created by the space between the inner and outer catheters.\nFigure 14A  illustrates a dual lumen catheter with partially overlapping side ports for use in sub arachnoid to ventricular access.

{"patent_number": "EP3828199A1", "description_number": 220, "description_text": "For example, the present disclosure contemplates an antibody variant that possesses some but not all effector functions, which make it a desirable candidate for applications in which the half-life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions [e.g., complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)] are unnecessary or deleterious. In vitro and/or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction/depletion of CDC and/or ADCC activities. For example, Fc receptor (FcR) binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks Fc\u03b3R binding (hence likely lacking ADCC activity), but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express Fc\u03b3RIII only, whereas monocytes express Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII and Fc\u03b3RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in, for example,  Ravetch and Kinet (1991) Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9:457-492 .

Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and natural killer (NK) cells.

C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity [see, e.g., C1q and C3c binding ELISA in  WO 2006/029879  and  WO 2005/100402 ].

The use of such adhesive prevented minor delamination and was viable for 10 attempted uses in a subsequent trial.

{"patent_number": "EP4240113A1", "description_number": 25, "description_text": "Further referring to  FIG. 3 ,  FIG. 4 ,  FIG. 5  and  FIG. 6 , the load is connected between the output terminal L_LOAD and the N line, when an overcurrent or short circuit occurs, the large current flows through the fuse F1, the primary side of the current transformer CT1, the field effect transistor Q1, the field effect transistor Q2, the load and the cable, etc., and then returns to the N line to form the entire circuit. When a large current flows through the primary side of the current transformer CT1, its secondary side coil will induce a current signal of equal proportion (actually 1000: 1), applying to the detection resistors R50 and R51, the greater the current, the voltage on the detection resistor (ISEN signal) will increase proportionally, the ISEN signal passes through the electronic rectifier composed of rectifier U7A and rectifier U7C (similar to the effect of rectifier diode, the advantage of electronic rectification is that there is no offset loss of PN junction, and the waveform is not distorted), the steamed bun wave of DC component is output at the 8th pin of the rectifier U7C, and then through the resistor R36, it is input to the positive input port of the comparator U7D (Pin 12 in the figures), and compared with the reference voltage of the negative input port (Pin 13 in the figures), if the voltage exceeds 2.667V, then the output port (Pin 14 in the figures) will output a high level, the base of the transistor Q7 is positively biased through the resistor R38, the collector and the emitter of the transistor Q7 are turned on, the base of the transistor Q8 becomes low level, the collector and the emitter of the transistor Q8 are turned on, the high level is added to the base of the transistor Q7 through the resistor R40, forcing the collector and the emitter of the transistor Q7 to continue to conduct; the collector of the transistor Q7 quickly pulls down the base of the transistor Q3 through the diode D8, the collector and emitter of the transistor Q3 are turned off, the collector and the emitter of the transistor Q4 are turned on, and the second and third pins of the driving optocoupler M1 are short-circuited. The 6th and 7th pins of the driving optocoupler M1 output a low level, and the gate voltages of the field effect transistor Q1 and the field effect transistor Q2 are low level, the drain and source of field effect transistor Q1 are cut off, the drain and source of field effect transistor Q2 are cut off, the output current is cut off, and the field effect transistor Q1 and field effect transistor Q2 are protected in time. The risk of damage due to overheating due to high current is avoided. However, in the actual circuit, due to the existence of the parasitic inductance and capacitive reactance of the cable at the load end (the LED drive power has input capacitance), at the moment when the large current is disconnected, the parasitic inductance will generate a back electromotive force, forming a voltage spike, which is superimposed on the drain and source ends of the field effect transistor Q1 and the drain and source ends of the field effect transistor Q2. At this time, the rectifier bridge stack BD2 will rectify this voltage spike and then charge the capacitor C37. Microscopically, the two ends of the capacitor are equivalent to a constant voltage source. Using the principle that the voltage across the large capacitor cannot change abruptly, during the charging process, the rising slope of the spike voltage is forced to become slow, and the high spike voltage is suppressed to break down the main power MOS transistor field effect transistor Q1 and field effect transistor Q2. Resistor R74 and resistor R78 discharge the capacitor C37, and at the same time connect the transient suppression diode TVS tube in parallel at both ends of the capacitor C37 (the voltage-stabilizing diode D2, voltage-stabilizing diode D4 and voltage-stabilizing diode D7 are connected in series), to prevent the load power and capacitive reactance from being too large, and to avoid the generated back electromotive force energy being larger, the voltage on the capacitor C37 will be higher. When the avalanche voltage of the TVS tube (i.e. voltage-stabilizing diode D2, voltage-stabilizing diode D4 and voltage-stabilizing diode D7) is exceeded, it will turn on and absorb the spike current and enter the clamping state. The clamping voltage is below the withstand voltage of field effect transistor Q 1 and field effect transistor Q2 of 650V, which realizes double protection of the main power transistor (i.e. field effect transistor Q1 and field effect transistor Q2). The other way of the collector of the transistor Q7 pulls down the third pin of the main control chip U200 through the diode D9, after the software program makes a judgment, it quickly enters the protection, forcing the first pin of the main control chip U200 to stop outputting the PWM waveform, which also stops the output of the dimmer, and the dimmer stops. After that, the program delays for one minute, restarts the work automatically, and outputs a high level of 2ms from the 48th pin of the main control chip U200, so that the collector and emitter of the transistor Q9 are turned on, and the base of the transistor Q7 is pulled down. The collector of the transistor Q7 becomes a high level, the collector and the emitter of the transistor Q8 are turned off, forming an unlock, and the dimmer can achieve dimming normally; if the short circuit is not removed, the BRCT clamping and absorbing circuit with short-circuit protection will continue to protect again, and so on, until the short-circuit is removed, the dimmer automatically resumes normal operation and can achieve dimming.", "true_sdg": "SDG9", "sdg_balise": "SDG 9", "reason_balise": "The text describes a technical circuit design focused on overcurrent protection mechanisms in electrical systems, involving components like fuses, transistors, and optocouplers.
