PROMIS<®> is part of a National Institutes of Health Roadmap initiative. Its stated goal is \"to provide clinicians and researchers access to efficient, precise, valid, and responsive adult- and child-reported measures of health and well-being\" (HealthMeasures 2013). The PROMIS initiative used modern measurement theory and a scientifically rigorous approach for instrument development involving quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods. This approach yielded patient self-report item banks with excellent psychometric properties. The PROMIS-SD (HealthMeasures WWW) patient self-report item bank was developed through an iterative process of literature searches, collecting and sorting items, expert content review, qualitative patient research, and pilot testing. The resulting 27 items assess self-reported perceptions of sleep quality, sleep depth, and restoration associated with sleep. This includes perceived difficulties and concerns with getting to sleep or staying asleep, as well as perceptions of the adequacy of, and satisfaction with, sleep. The PROMIS-SD has demonstrated excellent measurement properties including internal consistency and convergent validity. Validity of the item bank was supported by moderate to high correlations with existing scales and by the ability to distinguish among those with and without sleep disorders (Buysse et al 2010). The PROMIS-SD has been tested and exhibited validity evidence (e.g., expected associations, discrimination among known groups) in a wide range of populations (Busse et al 2013, Cook et al 2012, Fenton et al 2011, Stachler et al 2014). Subsequent research using item analyses and clinical judgement reduced the 27-item scale to 8 items. The authors reported the 8-item version to have \"greater measurement precision than the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)\" (Yu et al 2012). Further item reduction produced a 4-item version (PROMIS-SF SD 4a). The resulting 4 items measure sleep quality, sleep initiation, problems with sleep, and restfulness. Research conducted by Jensen et al (2016) demonstrated the 4-item version to have adequate reliability and validity. Each question has 5 response options ranging in value from 1 to 5. For scoring, the total raw score is found by summing the values of the response to each question. With the total raw score calculated, the applicable score conversion table is used in PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Scoring Manual to translate the total raw score into a T-score for each participant. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10.

This, however, comes with a huge disadvantage insofar as HFC-152a has enormous Global Warming Potential (GWP) when compared to the usual hydrocarbon propellants. GWP is a well-known parameter that describes the impact of a greenhouse gas on global heating; a higher the GWP, the more a particular gas will contribute to global warming, the lower the GWP number, the more environmentally friendly is the gas. This hydrofluorocarbon option is further complicated by recent regulation on the amount of HFC-152a that can be produced and consumed in the US by The American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act which has been enacted by Congress and looks to reduce the production of HFC-152a by 40% and ultimately by 85%, which means there will be an increase the demand and price of HFC 152a as supply dwindles. An example of an environmentally-friendly solvent is water, which would reduce VOC content, but is typically not considered for use as a solvent for dry shampoo sprays for two major reasons: water does not feel dry on the hair when compared to a volatile solvent like ethanol; and it makes the powders clump and stick together which hinders dispensing as well as performance.

The term \"stabilized IgG4 constant region\" will be understood to mean an IgG4 constant region that has been modified to reduce Fab arm exchange or the propensity to undergo Fab arm exchange or formation of a half-antibody or a propensity to form a half antibody. \"Fab arm exchange\" refers to a type of protein modification for human IgG4, in which an IgG4 heavy chain and attached light chain (half-molecule) is swapped for a heavy-light chain pair from another IgG4 molecule. Thus, IgG4 molecules may acquire two distinct Fab arms recognizing two distinct antigens (resulting in bispecific molecules). Fab arm exchange occurs naturally in vivo and can be induced in vitro by purified blood cells or reducing agents such as reduced glutathione. A \"half antibody\" forms when an IgG4 antibody dissociates to form two molecules each containing a single heavy chain and a single light chain.", "true_sdg": "SDG3", "predicted_sdg": "SDG4", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 0.5143368244171143, "line_number": 102}

After 10 minutes a solution of 5 g citric acid in 21 kg of water was under constant mixing for 10 minutes. 21 kg of water was then added and mixed for 10 minutes. Finally, a solution of 5 g citric acid in 21 kg of water was add and the mixture was mixed for 200 minutes.\nA portion of the material from the mixing bowl was placed with a spoon on a silicone sheet on a stainless steel tray. Using a plastic spatula the material was spread until it appeared uniform without spilling over the edges. This was repeated using additional trays until all of the material was spread on trays.\nThe trays were placed in an oven set to 70° C. When drying was complete (48 hours) the trays were removed from the oven.\nThe sheets of dried material were broken into smaller pieces that could be easily ground. The grinding was started by inserting the material slowly into a collection bin to insure that the material did not overheat on grinding. At the end of the grinding, the material was sieved between 100 and 1600 µm.\nThe ground material was placed in a stainless steel drum. The drum was placed in an oven heated to 120 (±1) °C to induce crosslinking. The drum was removed from the oven after 4 hours. 1 kg of the crosslinked material was placed in a stainless steel tank with 150 kg water with constant stirring at room temperature for 4 hours. The resulting swollen material was filtered using a sieve and the water was removed using a vacuum pump. The ratio of swelling obtained was 73.2 g/g. The washed material was placed on plastic trays. Using a plastic spatula, the material was spread evenly in the trays. The trays were placed in an oven set to 70 (±1) °C. After drying was complete (72 h), the trays were removed from the oven.\nThe dried material was inserted slowly into the collection bin of a grinder to insure that it would not overheat on grinding. The ground material was sieved between 100 and 1000 µm.\nThe media uptake ratio of the resulting powder, determined as set forth in Example 5, was 70.29 g/g. The G' determined as described in Example 5 was 2967 Pa.\nCitric acid crosslinked carboxymethylcellulose was also prepared using the general method above, but with a total of 15.0 g citric acid.

The multi-step process is thought to underlie a number of different neurologic conditions. The disease specific proteins undergo a specific biochemical modification which makes them prone to join and form globular intermediates (known as oligomers). These oligomers are thought to be toxic and can continue to build on one another forming protofibrils and fibrils. The fibrils may then be isolated into an intracellular inclusion (e.g. tau tangles) or an extracellular deposit (e.g. Aβ plaque) in the case of Alzheimer's disease.\nFigure 6A  illustrates a schematic of the ventricular, spinal and ventriculo-spinal approaches for accessing the CSF space for the efficient turnover of conditioned CSF.  Figure 6B  illustrates one embodiment of the dual- and single- ventricular approaches of the invention.

A single-lumen system creates a local eddy (shading) with minimal mixing or access to cranial CSF.\nFigure 8A  illustrates a schematic of a dual lumen system of the invention. A multi-lumen system creates an active and dynamic flow with efficient mixing that is not limited by pressure volume as inflow and outflow are relatively equal. This allows for parallel processing of CSF with maximum turnover and provides access to the cranial and spinal space and entire CSF volume (mixing represented by shading).  Figure 8B  illustrates the dramatic difference in CSF clearance produced with a multilumen system in which inflow and outflow are substantially apart (line D), adjacent (line C) compared to a single lumen system (line B) compared to diffusion-limited flow (line A).  Figure 8C  illustrates the effect of catheter inflow/outflow distance on the rate of reprocessing of conditioned CSF.\nFigure 9A and 9B  illustrates cross-sections of sample dual or multilumen catheters, respectively, for use in the CSF space. These are but two examples of many embodiments that may be envisioned to achieve one of the ultimate goals of the invention which is a method to provide efficient mixing and turnover of CSF.\nFigure 10  illustrates catheters with helical out flow paths which induce additional mixing at various outflow points.  Figure 10A  illustrates a single helical outflow path over last length (1) of catheter. A straight outflow lumen connects to the helical path. The catheter comprises a straight central inflow lumen.  Figure 10B  illustrates a dual helical outflow path catheter with central inflow path.\nFigure 11A  illustrates dual helical outflow paths exiting at different points along the catheter. The catheter comprises a single central inflow path. As described herein, the paths can be reversed, for example, by a pump mechanism. Therefore, a catheter with a single inflow path and multiple outflow paths could become a single outflow path with multiple inflow paths.  Figure 11B  illustrates how helical path directional changes as another means of creating a directed flow.\nFigure 12A  illustrates two catheters bound by a double collar. The collar is fixed to one catheter and slips on other such that the distance \"d\" between the two ends is adjustable. In this case, the inflow catheter is interfaced with the slipping portion of the collar.  Figure 12B  illustrates a dual lumen catheter that is encircled by a tight fitting thin walled cannula. The outflow lumen of the inner catheter has side ports such that, as the cannula is pulled back additional side ports or openings are exposed, thereby increasing the distance between the inflow and outflow.\nFigure 13A  illustrates a dual lumen catheter with addressable holes on one lumen.  Figure 13B  illustrates a two catheter system creating a dual lumen catheter. As shown, the outflow catheter is created by the space between the inner and outer catheters.\nFigure 14A  illustrates a dual lumen catheter with partially overlapping side ports for use in sub arachnoid to ventricular access. The holes surrounded by parenchyma would be sealed by the parenchyma. These would include the overlapping portion.  Figure 14B  illustrates a close-up of an end showing one overlapping hole on the left.  Figure 14C  illustrates a middle section showing overlapping holes.\nFigure 15A  illustrates an end section.  Figure 15B  illustrates a catheter incorporating multiple balloons. The inflow and outflow lumens are seen on either side of the base \"T-section.\" The balloon inflation lumen is above the T-section. The three balloon inflation ports can be seen from the top through thin membranes which form the balloons.  Figure 15C  illustrates a cross-section of an end with inflow and balloon inflation lumens visible along with an inflation port.\nFigure 16A-C  illustrates balloons inflated. A catheter can contain single or multiple balloons. The balloons can be spherical or long. Long slender balloons are well-suited for a spinal column space. The distance between balloons can be uniform or of different lengths.", "true_sdg": "SDG3", "predicted_sdg": "SDG10", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 1.7020165920257568, "line_number": 122}

Kinase inhibition assays were performed with the kinase domain (JH1) of JAK1 in the presence of increasing amounts of human full-length CIS (CIS), CIS lacking the PEST motif (ΔPEST), CIS lacking both the N-terminal region and the PEST motif (ΔNT/ΔPEST), or CIS lacking the N-terminal 34 residues (ΔN34), without (a) or with (b), excess phenyl phosphate (PP) as a competitor. (c) Alternatively, 50 µM JAK1-Y1034 or JAK3-Y980,Y981 phosphopeptides were used as competitor. Data were normalised to no-CIS controls. All CIS constructs contained the SOCS box and were expressed and purified as a trimeric complex consisting of CIS, elongin B and elongin C. Inset: table shows IC50 values for (a).\nFigure 12 - Deletion of the CIS N-terminal region or PEST motif does not have a major impact on binding to phosphopeptide. Isothermal calorimetry (ITC) was used to measure (a) the affinity of human full-length CIS, CIS lacking the PEST motif (ΔPEST), CIS lacking both the N-terminal region and the PEST motif (ΔNT/ΔPEST), or CIS lacking the N-terminal 34 residues (ΔN34) binding to phosphopeptides corresponding to tyrosines within the JAK1 kinase domain activation loop (JAK1-Y1034). (b) The affinity of human full-length CIS and CISΔNT/ΔPEST binding to phosphopeptides corresponding to tyrosines within the JAK3 kinase domain activation loop (JAK3-Y980,Y981). 300 µM phosphopeptides were titrated into a 30 µM solution of the GST-CIS-SH2-BC ternary complex. ITC titration curves are shown. The titration curves all fitted well to a single-site model.\nFigure 13- CIS-SH2 domain binds to an extended peptide interface. Isothermal calorimetry (ITC) was used to measure the affinity of CIS lacking both the N-terminal region and the PEST motif (ΔNT/ΔPEST) binding to phosphopeptides corresponding to tyrosines within the JAK1 kinase domain activation loop (JAK1-Y1034). Peptides were either wild-type or contained an alanine substitution at the +5, +3 or -3 position. 300 µM phosphopeptides were titrated into a 30 µM solution of the GST-CIS-SH2-BC ternary complex. ITC titration curves are shown. The titration curves all fitted well to a single-site model.\nFigure 14- CIS inhibition is dose dependent and requires a functional SH2 domain. (a) NK cells were purified from the spleens of Cish<-/->, Cish<+/-> and Cish<+/+> mice, labeled with the cell tracking dye CTV and cultured for 6 days in an increasing concentration of IL-15, prior to flow cytometry analysis. A decrease in total fluoresence (Geo Mean) indicates an increase in proliferation. (b) Equal numbers of NK cells from the spleens of Cish<-/->Cish<+/-> and Cish<+/+> mice were expanded in IL-15 for 10 days. Absolute NK cell numbers post-culture. (c) NK cells were then washed free of cytokine and rested for 4 h prior to treatment with 100 ng/mL IL-15 and 10 µM MG132, as indicated. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies to CIS and actin as a loading control.\nFigure 15- The kinetics of CIS induction are consistent with inhibition of JAK/STAT signalling in human NK cells. Patient-derived human NK cells (a) or NK lymphoma cell lines (b) SNK-10, (c) NKL and NK6, (d) NK-92 were washed free of cytokine and rested for 4 h (a) or 16 h (b-d) prior to treatment with IL-15 for the indicated times. In some instances, cells were incubated with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (10 µM). Cells were lysed and analysed by immunoblotting with antibodies to the indicated phosphorylated (p) and total proteins.\nFigure 16- The kinetics of Cish mRNA induction are consistent with inhibition of JAK/STAT signalling in human NK cells. Human NK lymphoma cell lines KHYG-1 (a-c) and NK-92 (D-F) were washed free of cytokine and rested overnight prior to treatment with IL-15 for the indicated times. Cells were lysed and analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) for Cish, Socs1, Socs3 mRNA expression. Relative expression was determined by normalizing the amount of each gene of interest to the housekeeping gene 18s ribosomal RNA. Each condition had three biological replicates and measurements were performed in duplicate.\nFigure 17- Schematic summarising the ubiquitination (U) and phosphorylation (P) sites identified by mass spectrometry. P=phosphorylation, U=ubiquitination, *indicates residues are conservation between mouse and human CIS. FLAG-tagged mouse CIS was expressed in 293T cells and purified by affinity enrichment using anti-FLAG antibodies, prior to digestion with trypsin and LC-MS/MS analysis. Bold circles indicate residues identified in this study. Other ubiquitination sites were reported in Jensik et al., 2015.\nFigure 18- TGFβ blocks IL-15-driven proliferation in wild-type, but not CIS-deficient NK cells.

(C) Groups of 7-10 B6.WT (Cish<+/+>) and B6.Cish<-/-> mice were injected i.p. with 1 x 10<5> parental RMA-S cells and treated with either PBS or recombinant IL-2 (100,000 IU i.p. on days 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4). Mice were monitored for tumor development and were euthanized at the point of abdominal swelling and discomfort. Improved survival between groups was assessed by the Log-rank Mantel-Cox test. (D) Groups of 5-15 B6.WT (Cish<+/+>) or B6.Cish<-/-> mice were injected i.v. with 5 x 10<5> RM-1 prostate carcinoma cells and treated with either cIg, anti-CD96, anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD1/anti-CTLA-4 combination (250 µg i.p. each on days 0 and 3).

Lungs were harvested on (A, D, F) day 14 or (B, E) day 13 and macrometastases counted. Individual mice are shown by each symbol and the results are plotted as mean ± SEM. Statistically significant differences as indicated were determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-test (for multiple comparisons) (*: p <0.5; **: p < 0.01; ***: p < 0.001; ****: p <0.0001).\nFigure 21 - Combining Cish-deficiency with BRAF or MEK kinase inhibitors demonstrates an improved anti-metastatic effect. Groups of 5-10 B6.WT (Cish<+/+>) and B6.Cish<-/-> mice were inoculated i.v. with 7.5 x 10<5> LWT1 melanoma cells and treated with either vehicle, BRAF inhibitor (PLX4720; daily for 6 days; 10 mg/kg i.p.) and/or MEK inhibitor (MEKi; trametinib, days 0 and 3, 0.6 mg/kg oral gavage). Lungs were harvested on day 14 and macrometastases counted. Individual mice are shown by each symbol and the results are plotted as mean ± S.E.M. Statistically significant differences as indicated were determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-test (for multiple comparisons) (n.s. not significant; ***: p < 0.001; ****: p <0.0001).\nFigure 22 - Cish-deficient mice are protected from MCA-induced tumor development. (A) Groups of 15 B6.WT (Cish<+/+>) and 18 B6.Cish<-/-> male mice were inoculated s.c. in the hind flank with 300 jug of MCA in 0.1 ml of corn oil. Mice were then monitored for fibrosarcoma development over 250 days, and data were recorded as a percentage of tumor free mice (tumors > 3 mm in diameter were recorded as positive). (B) Groups of 16-18 B6.WT (Cish<+/+>) and 14 B6.Cish<-/-> male mice were inoculated s.c. in the hind flank with 300 µg of MCA in 0.1 ml of corn oil. Mice were treated with either 250 µg hamster cIg, 50 µg anti-asialoGMl (anti-asGMl; NK cell depletion) or 250 µg anti-IFN-y antibodies injected i.p. on days -1, 0, 7, 12, 24, 28, 35 and 42. Mice were monitored for fibrosarcoma development over 200 days. Tumors were measured every week with a caliper square as the product of two perpendicular diameters (mm<2>). Mice were euthanized when the tumor reached >150 mm<2> in square-diameter. Statistically significant survival differences between the groups were determined by Log-rank Mantel-Cox test (A) followed by Bonferroni-correction for multiple testing (B) (*: p<0.05; ***: p < 0.001).\nFigure 23- Cish-deficient mice show enhanced survival in an acute myeloid leukemia model.Cish<+/+> (WT) and Cish<-/-> mice were injected i.v. with 5 x 10<5> MLL-AF9 cells. Mice were euthanised when an enlarged spleen and/or hind-leg paralysis was detected, according to ethical guidelines. Survival curve results are from two independent experiments. Each group had n≥5 mice per experiment. ***p<0.05.\nFigure 24- Loss of CIS function in NK cells results in enhanced turnover and differentiation towards more mature NK cells in vivo. Spleens were harvested from Cish<-/-> and Cish<+/+> mice and processed into single cell suspensions. Surface and intracellular staining was performed by flow cytometry to determine: (A) The percentage of Cish<+/+> and Cish<-/-> cells in different NK cell subsets. Total NK cells were identified as being NK1.1+ NKp46+ and were further subdivided into immature NK cells (CD27+ CD11b-; Imm), M1 (CD27+ CD11b+) and M2 (CD27- CD11b+) subsets, with M2 denoting the most mature and cytotoxic NK cell population. (B) The number of DNAM1+ KLRG1+ NK cells. In general, DNAM+ cells show greater production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and heightened response to IL-15, whilst KLRG1 is considered to be an alternative maturation marker (C) The percentage of Ki67+ cells in each NK cell subset (Imm, M1, M2). Ki67 is a marker for cellular proliferation. n=6 mice per group. p<0.05. Collectively, these data show that although the total number of NK cells did not differ between Cish<+/+> and Cish<-/-> mice, Cish<-/-> NK cells were more mature and likely to display increased cytokine production and cytotoxicity, with all Cish<-/-> subsets showing increased cell cycling.\nFigure 25- Enhanced control of MCA1956 sarcoma requires both NK cells and CD8 T cells.

All cell lines were cultured under standard conditions and sub-cultured as recommended by the supplier at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. ;Isolation of PBMC from buffy coats and enrichment of human NK cells;[0159]    PBMCs were isolated from buffy coats (German Red Cross, Mannheim, Germany) by density gradient centrifugation. The buffy coat samples were diluted with a two-to-threefold volume of PBS (Invitrogen, cat.: 14190-169), layered on a cushion of Lymphoprep (Stem Cell Technologies, cat.: 07861) and centrifuged at 800 x g for 25 min at room temperature w/o brake. PBMC located in the interface were collected and washed 3 times with PBS before they were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 IU/mL penicillin G sodium and 100 µg/mL streptomycin sulfate (all components from Invitrogen)) overnight without stimulation. For the enrichment of NK cells PBMC were harvested from overnight cultures and used for one round of negative selection using the EasySep<™> Human NK Cell Enrichment Kit (Stem Cell Technologies, cat.: 17055) for the immunomagnetic isolation of untouched human NK cells and the Big Easy EasySep<™> Magnet (Stem Cell Technologies, cat.: 18001) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ;Preloading of NK cells and freeze/thaw;[0160]    Aliquots of enriched primary human NK cells were resuspended in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 µg/mL of the indicated antibody constructs in a total volume of 0.5 mL and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. As indicated, half of the aliquots was washed twice with 5 mL complete RPMI 1640 medium and then resuspended in 0.5 mL complete RPMI 1640 medium, and the second half of the aliquots was not washed before FCS supplemented with 20% DMSO (Sigma) was added. The cell suspensions were then transferred to 2 mL cryo tubes (Greiner bio-one) and frozen at -80°C in cryo 1°C freezing container (Nalgene) for more than 12 h. ;4 h calcein-release cytotoxicity assays;[0161]    For calcein-release cytotoxicity assays the indicated target cells were harvested from cultures, washed with RPMI 1640 medium without FCS, and labeled with 10 µM calcein AM (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, cat.: C3100MP) for 30 min in RPMI medium without FCS at 37°C. After gently washing the labeled cells were resuspended in complete RPMI 1640 medium to a density of 1×10<5>/mL, and aliquots of 1×10<4> target cells were then seeded in individual wells of a 96-well round-bottom micro plate. In parallel, NK cells were thawed from -80°C by incubation of the cryo tubes in a 37°C water bath. When the last ice crystals were visible, the cell suspension was diluted with complete RPMI 1640 medium centrifuged and washed once before the cells were added to the target cells at the indicated effector-to-target (E:T) ratio with or without addition of fresh antibody as indicated in a total volume of 200 µL in duplicates. Spontaneous release was determined by incubation of target cells in the absence of effector cells and without antibodies, and maximal release was induced by the addition of 1% Triton x-100 (final concentration, Roth) and also measured in quadruplicate on each plate. ;[0162]    After centrifugation for 2 min at 200 g the assay was incubated for 4 h at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. 100 µL cell culture supernatant were harvested from each well after an additional centrifugation for 5 min at 500 g, and the fluorescence of the released calcein was measured at 520 nm using a fluorescence multi-plate reader (Victor 3 or EnSight, Perkin Elmer). On the basis of the measured counts, the specific cell lysis was calculated according to the following formula: [fluorescence (sample) - fluorescence (spontaneous)] / [fluorescence (maximum) - fluorescence (spontaneous)] × 100%. Fluorescence (spontaneous) represents the fluorescent counts from target cells in the absence of effector cells and antibodies and fluorescence (maximum) represents the total cell lysis induced by the addition of Triton X-100. Lysis values were analyzed and mean and standard deviation were plotted using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Prism version 7.04 for Windows, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA). ;[0163]    The results are shown in  figure 1 . ;Example 2: Analysis of binding of anti-CD16 antibodies to different antigen variants;[0164]    FcgRIII (CD16), the low-affinity receptor for the Fc part of IgG exists in two isoforms encoded by two nearly identical genes: FCGR3A (CD16A) and FCGR3B (CD16B), resulting in tissue-specific expression of alternative membrane-anchored isoforms ( Ravetch and Perussia, 1989, J Exp Med. ):\nFcgRIIIA (CD16A) is expressed as a transmembrane protein on NK cells, makrophages, and subsets of monocytes and T-cells\nFcgRIIIB (CD16B) is expressed glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored by neutrophils and after gamma-interferon stimulation by eosinophils.;[0165]    Allelic variants/polymorphisms of both, CD16A and CD16B are well known (summarized in Table 2). ;[0166]    CD16B allotypic variants differ in five amino acids of the extracellular domain (ECD) (Table 2). Two of these enable additional glycosylation, resulting in three different variants of the GPI-anchored FcyRIIIB granulocyte antigens HNA-1a, -1b, and -1c (formerly named NA1, NA2 and SH). ;[0167]    There are only few differences in the amino acid sequences of CD16A and B. Their differences are restricted to two alternative amino acids in the mature ECD (Table 2). Additional differences reside in the disparate modes of membrane anchorage of CD16A and CD16B. The C-terminal propeptide sequence of CD16B which is cleaved off in the mature GPI-anchored form is highly homologous to the sequence connecting CD16A ECD to its transmembrane domain (Table 2).\nTable 2: Summary of sequence variations of FcgRIIIA (CD16A) and FcgRIIIB (CD16B) alleles. We use amino acid numbers displayed in the left column. Corresponding numbering from Uniprot is shown on the right for comparison.

In addition, CD16B ECD mutants in which CD16B-specific amino acids were replaced with the corresponding residues of CD16A were constructed, expressed and tested in binding assays: CD16B<D129G>, CD16B<H140Y>, CD16B<S185F>. All these antigen variants were fused via glycin-serin linker to soluble monomeric Fc ( Ying et al, 2012, J. Biol. Chem. ), expressed in CHO and purified from cell culture supernatants. ;[0171]    A scFv antibody comprising the variable heavy and light chain sequences of the published CD16A- and CD16B-reactive antibody 3G8 recognizes all tested CD16A and CD16B antigen variants ( Figure 2 , Table 3). Different antibodies containing the variable heavy and light chain sequences of \"LSIV21\" or the affinity-improved \"P2C47\" (in form of monovalent scFv or bivalently binding tetravalent bispecific tandem diabody antibodies) recognizes CD16A but not the mature or propeptide-containing ECD fusion antigens of CD16B. If however Histidine (H) at position 140 in the CD16B ECD was mutated to Tyrosine (Y) - the amino acid present at the corresponding position in CD16A - this mutant form of CD16B (CD16B<H140Y>) was well recognized by antibodies containing the \"LSIV21\" or \"P2C47\" variable domains ( Figure 2 , Table 3).\nTable 3: Summary of binding of different anti-CD16 antibodies to coated CD16 antigen variants analyzed in ELISA.

Results show that except for scFv \"CD16-5\" which shows weak cross-reactivity with CD16B, the other affinity matured anti-CD16 scFv antibodies maintain the CD16A selective binding property of the parental antibody. They do not bind to CD16B, unless CD16B contains the previously described amino acid exchange CD16B<H140Y> (Table 4). All anti-CD16 antibodies show very good cross-reactivity with cynomolgus CD16A (Table 4), despite the fact that the cynomolgus CD16A ECD sequence differs in a total of 16 amino acids from human CD16A (see alignment in  Figure 4 ). ;[0173]    The importance of Tyrosine (Y) at position 140 in the CD16 ECD for CD16A-specific recognition by our antibodies was also confirmed using recombinant CHO cells with transgenic expression of different CD16 antigen variants on the cell surface. ECD sequences were either fused to the transmembrane domain of human EGFR ( Wang et al., 2011, Blood 118(5)1255 ) or anchored via GPI using the human CD16B endogenous sequence with the full length propeptide sequence for posttranslational processing and lipidation for GPI-anchorage. ;[0174]    scFv antibody comprising the variable heavy and light chain sequences of the published CD16A- and CD16B-reactive antibody 3G8 recognizes all cell surface expressed CD16A and CD16B antigen variants ( Figure 3 ), but not recombinant EGFR expressed as a specificity control. scFv antibodies containing the variable heavy and light chain sequences of \"LSIV21\" or the affinity-improved \"P2C47\" recognize CHO cell surface expressed CD16A variants but not the mature or propeptide-containing ECD of CD16B(NA1). If however Histidine (H) at position 140 in the CHO membrane-anchored CD16B ECD was mutated to Tyrosine (Y) - the amino acid present at the corresponding position in CD16A - this mutant form of CD16B (CD16BH140Y) was well recognized by scFv antibodies containing the \"LSIV21\" or \"P2C47\" variable domains ( Figure 3 ). ;[0175]    CD16A and CD16BH140Y antigen variants, but not CD16B antigen are also recognized after SDS-PAGE and Western blot when samples are treated under non-reducing conditions, by antibodies containing \"LSIV21\", \"P2C47\" or affinity matured variable domains ( Figure 5 ), whereas Antibody 3G8 recognizes all CD16A and CD16B antigen variants. When samples are reduced prior to loading on SDS-PAGE gels, no signals are obtained on Western blots (data not shown), suggesting a non-linear sequence, but rather three-dimensional structure as the binding epitope. In the case of recognition by \"LSIV21\", \"P2C47\" or affinity matured variants of these antibodies, the three-dimensional epitope structure is likely determined by Tyrosine in position 140 of CD16.\nTable 3: Summary of binding of different anti-CD16 antibodies to coated CD16 antigen variants analyzed in ELISA.

Crucial amino acids for the low-affinity interaction of FcgRIIIA (CD16A) with the Fc part of IgG were previously identified and described (e.g. Ahmed et al., 2016). Residues in CD16A involved in the interaction with the CH2 domain of Fc portions are K120, Y132, H134, H135 and K161. While the antibody 3G8 was reported to bind CD16A and CD16B and block IgG binding (Tamm and Schmidt, 1996), we did not observe blocking of binding of our anti-CD16 antibodies to CD16A by IgGs. To support the hypothesis that the binding site of our anti-CD16A specific antibodies is different from the IgG binding site on FcgRIIIA, we performed a competition ELISA. While binding of 3G8 mAb to CD16A is blocked with increasing concentrations of a scFv antibody containing the variable domains of 3G8, the other anti-CD16 scFv antibodies do not block or displace 3G8 mAb on CD16A and bind independently ( Figure 6 ). Since the 3G8 binding site is known to block IgG binding, we conclude that the binding site of our anti-CD16 antibodies is distinct from the IgG binding site. ;Analysis of binding in ELISA;[0177]    96-well ELISA plates (Immuno MaxiSorp; Nunc) were coated overnight at 4°C with recombinantly produced fusion proteins of CD16 extracellular domain (ECD) antigen variants fused to human IgG1 Fc or monomeric mFc.67 ( Ying et al, 2012, J. Biol. Chem. ) in 100mM Carbonate-bicarbonate buffer at a concentration of 1.5 or 3µg/mL. After a blocking step with 3% (w/v) skim milk powder (Merck) dissolved in PBS, serial dilutions of the different antibodies in PBS containing 0.3% (w/v) skim milk powder were incubated on the plates for 1.5h at room temperature. After washing three times with 300µL per well of PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, plates were incubated with detection antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. For the detection of His-tagged analytes, Penta-HIS-HRP (Qiagen) was used at 1:3000 dilution. For the detection of tetravalent bispecific BCMA/CD16 TandAb antibody, T763, Protein L-HRP conjugate (Pierce) was used at 1:20.000 dilution for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing three times with 300µL per well of PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, plates were incubated with Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Seramun) until color development was clearly visible. The reaction was stopped through the addition of 100µL per well of 0.5M H2SO4. The absorbance was measured at 450nm using a multilabel plate reader (Victor, Perkin Elmer). Absorbance values were plotted and analyzed using nonlinear regression, sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope), least squares (ordinary) fit with GraphPad Prism version 6.07 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA). ;Analysis of binding after SDS-PAGE and Western blot;[0178]    Purified recombinant CD16 antigen variants (human CD16A<48R>, <158V->mFc.67, human CD16B(NA1)<pr>-mFc.67 and huCD16B(NA1)<pr>H140Y-mFc.67 were diluted in PBS to 0,5µg/mL, mixed with an equal volume of non-reducing sample buffer and 8µl of the mix were loaded into the wells of 4-20% Criterion TGX Precast Gels (Biorad). Gels were run at 300V in 1x TGS buffer (Biorad) for 22min and total protein was imaged using the Biorad Molecular Imager Gel Documentation system. Protein was transferred by Western blotting to PVDF Midi Membranes (Biorad) using the Trans-Blot Turbo system (Biorad). Membranes were incubation for 30min with 3% (w/v) skimmed milk powder (Merck) dissolved in TBS to block unspecific binding sites and then incubated with primary antibody dilutions: anti-CD16 antibodies were diluted in TBS containing 3% (w/v) skimmed milk powder to a concentration of 4µg/mL and incubated on the membranes for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing with TBST (TBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) and two times with TBS, membranes were incubated with secondary antibody-detection conjugates: Membranes incubated with anti-CD16A containing scFv-IgAb antibodies were incubated with Protein L-HRP (Pierce), 1:10.000 diluted in TBS containing 3% (w/v) skimmed milk powder, membranes incubated with anti-CD16 scFv antibodies were incubated with anti-Penta-His-HRP (QIAGEN) 1:3000 diluted in TBS containing 3% (w/v) skimmed milk powder, for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing with TBST and two times with TBS, colorimetric development was started by addition of a freshly prepared mixture of 0.66mg/mL DAB, 0,02% CoCl2, 0.015% H2O2 in TBS and incubated on the membranes until color developed. Reaction was stopped by washing membranes in water. Membranes were dried and photographed. ;CD16A competition ELISA;[0179]    96-well ELISA plates (Immuno MaxiSorp; Nunc) were coated overnight at 4°C with recombinantly produced fusion proteins of CD16A(48R, 158V) ECD fused to monomeric mFc.67 ( Ying et al, 2012, J. Biol. Chem. ) in 100mM Carbonate-bicarbonate buffer at a concentration of 1.5µg/mL. After a blocking step with 3% (w/v) skim milk powder (Merck) dissolved in PBS, serial dilutions of the different scFv-antibodies in PBS containing 0.3% (w/v) skim milk powder were mixed with 1nM of anti-CD16 mAb 3G8 (BD Bioscience) and co-incubated on the plates for 1.5h at room temperature. After washing three times with 300µL per well of PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, plates were incubated with detection antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. For the detection of CD16A-bound 3G8, goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L)-HRPO (Dianova 115-035-003) was used at 1:10.000 dilution. After washing three times with 300µL per well of PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, plates were incubated with Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Seramun) until color development was clearly visible.

The buffy coat samples were diluted with a two-to-threefold volume of PBS (Invitrogen, cat.: 14190-169), layered on a cushion of Lymphoprep (Stem Cell Technologies, cat.: 07861) and centrifuged at 800 x g for 25 min at room temperature w/o brake. PBMC located in the interface were collected and washed 3 times with PBS before they were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 IU/mL penicillin G sodium, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin sulfate (all components from Invitrogen) overnight without stimulation.

After repeated washing with FACS buffer, cell-bound antibodies were detected with 10 µg/mL anti-His mAb 13/45/31-2 (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany, cat.: DIA910-1MG) followed by 15 µg/mL FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Dianova, cat.: 115-095-062). After the last staining step, the cells were washed again and resuspended in 0.2 mL of FACS buffer containing 2 µg/mL propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma, cat.: P4170) in order to exclude dead cells. The fluorescence of 2-5 × 103 living cells was measured using a Millipore Guava EasyCyte flow cytometer (Merck Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany) or CytoFlex cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany) and median fluorescence intensities of the cell samples were determined. After subtracting the fluorescence intensity values of the cells stained with the secondary and tertiary reagents alone, the values were used for non-linear regression analysis using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Prism version 7.04 for Windows, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA). For the calculation of KD, the equation for one-site-binding (hyperbola) was used. ;Results;[0182]    The anti-CD16 scFv containing the human Fv domains from clone CD16-1, scFv containing the human anti-CD16 Fv domains from clone CD16-2, and scFv_3G8, containing the murine Fv domains from mAb 3G8 were titrated on primary human NK cells at 37°C in the presence or absence of 10 mg/mL polyclonal human IgG.

All cell lines were cultured under standard conditions and sub-cultured as recommended by the supplier at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. ;Isolation of PBMC from buffy coats and enrichment of human NK cells;[0185]    PBMCs were isolated from buffy coats (German Red Cross, Mannheim, Germany) by density gradient centrifugation. The buffy coat samples were diluted with a two-to-threefold volume of PBS (Invitrogen, cat.: 14190-169), layered on a cushion of Lymphoprep (Stem Cell Technologies, cat.: 07861) and centrifuged at 800 x g for 25 min at room temperature w/o brake.

After adding 0.5 mL FCS supplemented with 20% DMSO (Sigma) cell suspensions were then transferred to 2 mL cryo tubes (Greiner bio-one) and frozen at -80°C in cryo 1°C freezing container (Nalgene) for more than 12 h. ;4 h calcein-release cytotoxicity assays;[0187]    For calcein-release cytotoxicity assays the indicated target cells were harvested from cultures, washed with RPMI 1640 medium without FCS, and labeled with 10 µM calcein AM (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, cat.: C3100MP) for 30 min in RPMI medium without FCS at 37°C. After gently washing the labeled cells were resuspended in complete RPMI 1640 medium to a density of 1×10<5>/mL, and aliquots of 1×10<4> target cells were then seeded in individual wells of a 96-well round-bottom micro plate. In parallel, NK cells were thawed from -80°C by incubation of the cryo tubes in a 37°C water bath. When the last ice crystals were visible, the cell suspension was diluted with complete RPMI 1640 medium centrifuged and washed once before the cells were added to the target cells at the indicated effector-to-target (E:T) ratio with or without addition of fresh antibody as indicated in a total volume of 200 µL in duplicates. Spontaneous release was determined by incubation of target cells in the absence of effector cells and without antibodies, and maximal release was induced by the addition of 1% Triton x-100 (final concentration, Roth) and also measured in quadruplicate on each plate. ;[0188]    After centrifugation for 2 min at 200 g the assay was incubated for 4 h at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. 100 µL cell culture supernatant were harvested from each well after an additional centrifugation for 5 min at 500 g, and the fluorescence of the released calcein was measured at 520 nm using a fluorescence multi-plate reader (Victor 3 or EnSight, Perkin Elmer). On the basis of the measured counts, the specific cell lysis was calculated according to the following formula: [fluorescence (sample) - fluorescence (spontaneous)] / [fluorescence (maximum) - fluorescence (spontaneous)] × 100%. Fluorescence (spontaneous) represents the fluorescent counts from target cells in the absence of effector cells and antibodies and fluorescence (maximum) represents the total cell lysis induced by the addition of Triton X-100. Lysis values were analyzed and mean and standard deviation were plotted using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Prism version 7.04 for Windows, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA). ;Results:;[0189]    Primary human NK cells that were pre-loaded with anti-EpCAM antibody constructs, such as EpCAM/NKp46 scFv-lgAb_73, EpCAM/NKG2D scFv-lgAb_75, EpCAM/CD16A scFv-lgAb_80, and IgG anti-EpCAM induced specific lysis of EpCAM-positive COLO 205 cells but not of EpCAM-negative KARPAS-299 cells. Among the bispecific anti-EpCAM constructs, NK cells preloaded with EpCAM/CD16A scFv-lgAb_80 exhibited the highest efficacy in COLO 205 cell lysis and NK cells loaded with EpCAM/NKG2D scFv-lgAb_75 the lowest efficacy. None of the NK cell preparations preloaded with anti-CD30 antibody constructs mediated substantial lysis of COLO 205 ( Figure 8A  and Table 5). ;[0190]    In contrast, NK cells that were pre-loaded with CD30/CD16A TandAb or Fc-enhanced IgG anti-CD30 mediated lysis of CD30-positive KARPAS-299 cells but not of CD30-negative COLO 205 cells. NK cells preloaded with wildtype IgG anti-CD30 did not mediate lysis of KARPAS-299 suggesting that this wildtype IgG anti-CD30 dissociated too fast from NK cells during freezing, thawing and washing, and that the number of remaining IgG was too low to mediate substantial target cell lysis ( Figure 8B  and Table 5). ;[0191]    Interstingly, NK cells that were preloaded with 10 µg/mL EpCAM/NKG2D scFv-lgAb_75 or CD30/CD16A TandAb, frozen, thawed, and washed induced similar lysis of COLO 205 or KARPAS-299 cells, respectively, as NK cells that were not preloaded but supplemented in the cytotoxicity assay with 10 µg/mL of fresh EpCAM/NKG2D scFv-lgAb_75 or CD30/CD16A TandAb.\nTable 5: Efficacy of target cell lysis by pre-loaded and frozen NK cells at an E:T ratio of 5:1. NK cells were preloaded with 10 µg/mL of the indicated antibody constructs or without antibody (w/o antibody) for 30 min at room temperature and then frozen at -80°C. Thawed NK cells were washed and used as effector cells in a 4 h calcein-release cytotoxicity assay on COLO 205 or KARPAS-299 target cells. As a control, EpCAM/NKG2D scFv-lgAb_75 and CD30/CD16A T116 were freshly added at a concentration of 10 µg/mL to NK cells that were not preloaded prior freezing (w/o antibody). Mean of duplicate lysis values at an E:T ratio of 5:1 are shown. Exp.

In Japan, approximately less than 20% of humans are negative for the Lewis blood groups and cannot synthesize Fucα1,4 linkages, and therefore, sialyl Le<a> cannot be genetically synthesized, resulting that CA19-9 cannot be a cancer marker in these cases. The present inventors have already found that typing of the Lewis blood group is difficult by a conventional serological tests and that accurate typing is not possible because cancer-related changes of phenotypes occur frequently (see Non-Patent Document 7). For accurate typing of Lewis blood groups, measurement of FUT6 enzyme activity or FUT6 genotyping is required (see Non-Patent Document 8). In addition to these limitations of CA19-9, the results in Table 1 indicate that the sensitivity of CA19-9 measurement for the diagnosis of IPMC is low, and the superiority of fAGP measurement for IPMN diagnosis and IPMC discrimination is clear.", "true_sdg": "SDG3", "predicted_sdg": "SDG10", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 0.5271210670471191, "line_number": 136}

{"patent_number": "EP3828199A1", "description_number": 220, "description_text": "For example, the present disclosure contemplates an antibody variant that possesses some but not all effector functions, which make it a desirable candidate for applications in which the half-life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions [e.g., complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)] are unnecessary or deleterious. In vitro and/or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction/depletion of CDC and/or ADCC activities. For example, Fc receptor (FcR) binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks FcγR binding (hence likely lacking ADCC activity), but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express FcγRIII only, whereas monocytes express FcγRI, FcγRII and FcγRIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in, for example,  Ravetch and Kinet (1991) Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9:457-492 . Non-limiting examples of in vitro assays to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest are described in  U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 ;  Hellstrom, I. et al. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Alternatively, non-radioactive assays methods may be employed (e.g., ACTI™, non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay for flow cytometry; CellTechnology, Inc. Mountain View, Calif.; and CytoTox 96® non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay, Promega, Madison, Wis.). Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and natural killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, for example, in an animal model such as that disclosed in  Clynes et al. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:652-656 . C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity [see, e.g., C1q and C3c binding ELISA in  WO 2006/029879  and  WO 2005/100402 ]. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay may be performed [see, e.g,Gazzano-Santoro et al. (1996) J. Immunol. Methods 202:163 ;  Cragg, M. S. et al. (2003) Blood 101:1045-1052 ; and  Cragg, M. S, and M. J. Glennie (2004) Blood 103:2738-2743 ]. FcRn binding and in vivo clearance/half-life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art [see, e.g.,Petkova, S. B. et al.

The spectrum is generally regarded as a shared spectrum, that is, communication devices in different communication systems may use the spectrum as long as they meet the regulatory requirements configured by countries or regions on the spectrum, without applying for exclusive spectrum authority to the government. In order to enable various communication systems using unlicensed spectrum for wireless communication to coexist amicably on this spectrum, some countries or regions have stipulated the legal requirements that must be met for using unlicensed spectrum. For example, in some regions, a communication device follows a \"Listen Before Talk (LBT)\" principle, that is, before transmitting a signal on a channel of an unlicensed spectrum, the communication device needs to conduct channel listening first, and the communication device can transmit a signal only when a result of channel listening is that the channel is idle. If the result of channel listening by the communication device on the unlicensed spectrum channel is that the channel is busy, the communication device cannot transmit a signal. In order to ensure fairness, in one transmission, a duration in which a communication device uses a channel on the unlicensed spectrum for a signal transmission cannot exceed Maximum Channel Occupation Time (MCOT).

Such a skeleton may be formed in a known manner, and for example, the skeleton of the carboxylic acid polyol may be formed by reacting a component comprising a carboxylic acid and a polyol (e.g., diol or triol, etc.), and the skeleton of the caprolactone polyol may be formed by reacting a component comprising a caprolactone and a polyol (e.g., diol or triol, etc.). The carboxylic acid may be a dicarboxylic acid. ;[0064]    In the polyol compound having the skeleton of Formula 2 above, a hydroxyl group or the above-described hydrocarbon group may be present at the terminal of the skeleton of Formula 2 above. ;[0065]    In this case, the skeleton of Formula 2 above may be represented by Formula 3 below.\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8c8f92b9-616d-46b7-9113-89d48615c068-ib0003\" />\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8c8f92b9-616d-46b7-9113-89d48615c068-ib0004\" />;\n[0066]    In Formula 3, X1, X2, L1, and n are as defined in Formula 2, and R1 may be a hydroxyl group or a substituent of Formula 4 below.\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8c8f92b9-616d-46b7-9113-89d48615c068-ib0005\" />;\n[0067]    In Formula 4, X3 is a single bond or an oxygen atom, and R is the same as R of Formula 1 above. ;[0068]    When R1 in Formula 3 is a hydroxy group, X1 may be a single bond, and when R1 is a substituent of Formula 4 above, either one of X1 and X3 may be a single bond, and the other may be an oxygen atom. ;[0069]    The lower limit of the number of skeletons of Formula 2 or 3 included in the polyol compound may be 1 or 2 or so, and the upper limit thereof may be 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 or 2 or so. The number of skeletons may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0070]    The polyol compound having a polyester skeleton may have a linear or branched structure. ;[0071]    Here, the linear structure is a structure in which a main chain including a skeleton of Formula 2 or 3 above is present and no other polymer chain is linked to the main chain, and the branched structure may be in a form that as a side chain, a chain including a skeleton of Formula 2 or 3 above is bonded to the main chain including a skeleton of Formula 2 or 3 above. Here, in the branched structure, the number of chains including the skeleton of Formula 2 or 3 above linked as the side chain may be, for example, 1 to 5, 1 to 4, 1 to 3, 1 to 2, or 1. ;[0072]    In one example, the polyol compound having a polyester skeleton may be a compound in the form that at least some of hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon compound such as an alkane, alkene or alkyne are substituted with the hydroxyl group and/or the skeleton of Formula 3 above. The number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon compound such as the alkane, alkene or alkyne may be, for example, 1 to 20, 1 to 16, 1 to 8, or 4 to 6. ;[0073]    Such a hydrocarbon compound such as the alkane, alkene or alkyne may be linear, branched, or cyclic. In addition, the hydroxyl group and/or the skeleton of Formula 3 may be substituted on the same carbon atom in the alkane, alkene, or alkyne, or may also be substituted on different carbon atoms. ;[0074]    In one example, the polyether skeleton may be a skeleton having a repeating unit of Formula 5 below.\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8c8f92b9-616d-46b7-9113-89d48615c068-ib0006\" />;\n[0075]    In Formula 5, X4 and X5 are each independently a single bond or an oxygen atom, L2 may be an alkylene group, and m is an arbitrary number. ;[0076]    In Formula 5, the alkylene group may be, in one example, an alkylene group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, 1 to 16 carbon atoms, 1 to 12 carbon atoms, 1 to 8 carbon atoms, or 1 to 4 carbon atoms, which may be linear or branched. ;[0077]    In Formula 5, m is an arbitrary number representing the number of repeating units, which may be, for example, a number within the range of 1 to 25. ;[0078]    The lower limit of m in Formula 5 may be 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21 or 23 or so, and the upper limit may be 25, 23, 21, 19, 17, 15, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5 or 3 or so. The m may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0079]    In the polyol compound having a skeleton of Formula 5, the hydroxyl group or the above-described hydrocarbon group may be present at the terminal of the skeleton of Formula 5 above. ;[0080]    In this case, the skeleton of Formula 5 above may be represented by Formula 6 below.\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8c8f92b9-616d-46b7-9113-89d48615c068-ib0007\" />;\n[0081]    In Formula 6, X4, X5, L2 and m are as defined in Formula 5, and R2 may be a hydroxyl group or a substituent of Formula 7 below.\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8c8f92b9-616d-46b7-9113-89d48615c068-ib0008\" />;\n[0082]    In Formula 7, X6 is a single bond or an oxygen atom, and R is the same as R in Formula 1 above. ;[0083]    When R2 in Formula 6 is a hydroxy group, X4 is a single bond, and when R2 is a substituent of Formula 7, either one of X4 and X6 is a single bond, and the other is an oxygen atom. ;[0084]    The lower limit of the number of skeletons of Formula 5 or 6 above included in the polyol compound may be 1 or 2 or so, and the upper limit thereof may be 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 or 2 or so. The number of skeletons may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0085]    The polyol compound having a polyether skeleton may have a linear or branched structure. ;[0086]    Here, the linear structure may be a structure in which a main chain including a skeleton of Formula 5 or 6 above is present and no other polymer chain is linked to the main chain, and the branched structure may be in a form that as a side chain, a chain including a skeleton of Formula 5 or 6 above is bonded to a main chain including a skeleton of Formula 5 or 6 above. Here, in the branched structure, the number of chains containing the skeleton of Formula 5 or 6 above linked as side chains may be, for example, 1 to 5, 1 to 4, 1 to 3, 1 to 2, or 1. ;[0087]    In one example, the polyol compound having the polyether skeleton may be a compound in the form that at least some of hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon compound such as an alkane, alkene or alkyne are substituted with a hydroxyl group and/or a skeleton of Formula 5 above. The number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon compound such as the alkane, alkene or alkyne may be, for example, 1 to 20, 1 to 16, 1 to 8, or 4 to 6. ;[0088]    Such a hydrocarbon compound such as the alkane, alkene or alkyne may be linear, branched, or cyclic. In addition, the hydroxy group and/or the skeleton of Formula 5 may be substituted on the same carbon atom in the alkane, alkene, or alkyne, or may also be substituted on different carbon atoms. ;[0089]    When the above-described polyol compound is an oligomeric or polymeric compound, the relevant compound may have an appropriate level of molecular weight. ;[0090]    For example, the lower limit of the weight average molecular weight of the oligomeric or polymeric polyol compound may be 100 g/mol, 200 g/mol, 300 g/mol, 400 g/mol, 500 g/mol, 600 g/mol, 700 g/mol, 800 g/mol or 900 g/mol or so, and the upper limit may also be 5000 g/mol, 4500 g/mol, 4000 g/mol, 3500 g/mol, 3000 g/mol, 2500 g/mol, 2000 g/mol, 1500 g/mol, 1000 g/mol or 800 g/mol or so. The weight average molecular weight may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0091]    By applying the oil-modified polyol as described above, it is possible to more effectively secure desired physical properties. ;[0092]    The oil-modified polyol compound may be present in an appropriate ratio in the resin composition. For example, the lower limit of the content of the oil-modified polyol compound in the resin composition may be 5 wt%, 10 wt%, 15 wt%, 20 wt%, 25 wt%, 30 wt%, 35 wt%, 40 wt%, 45 wt%, 50 wt%, 55 wt%, 60 wt%, 65 wt%, 70 wt%, 75 wt%, 80 wt%, 85 wt%, 90 wt% or 95 wt% or so, and the upper limit thereof may be 100 wt%, 95 wt%, 90 wt%, 85 wt%, 80 wt%, 75 wt%, 70 wt%, 65 wt%, 60 wt%, 55 wt%, 50 wt%, 45 wt%, 40 wt%, 35 wt%, 30 wt%, 25 wt% or 20 wt% or so. The content may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0093]    When the resin composition is a one-component type, the content of the oil-modified polyol compound is the content in the relevant one-component resin composition, and when it is a two-component composition, it is the content in the part where the oil-modified polyol compound is present. For example, when the two-component resin composition comprises a main part and a curing agent part that are physically separated, and the oil-modified polyol compound is included in the main part, the content of the oil-modified polyol may be a content based on the total weight of the main part. In addition, when the resin composition comprises a solvent and/or a filler, the content is a content based on weight excluding the contents of the solvent and filler. ;[0094]    In another example, the content of the oil-modified polyol compound may be a content based on 100 wt% of all polyol components present in the resin composition. ;[0095]    In another example, when the resin composition comprises a filler component to be described below, the lower limit of the content of the oil-modified polyol compound relative to 100 parts by weight of the filler component may be 1 part by weight, 3 parts by weight, 5 parts by weight, 7 parts by weight, 9 parts by weight, 11 parts by weight or 13 parts by weight or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 40 parts by weight, 35 parts by weight, 30 parts by weight, 25 parts by weight, 20 parts by weight, 15 parts by weight, 10 parts by weight, 8 parts by weight, 6 parts by weight, 4 parts by weight or 3 parts by weight or so. The content may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0096]    When the resin composition is a one-component type, the ratio to the filler component is the ratio relative to 100 parts by weight of the entire filler component included in the relevant resin composition, and in the case of a two-component type, it is the ratio relative to 100 parts by weight of the entire filler component present in the part (main part or curing agent part) where the oil-modified polyol is included. ;[0097]    The hydroxy functional component may, if necessary, also comprise an alcohol compound as an additional component. The term alcohol compound means a compound containing one hydroxy group per molecule. Such an alcohol compound may be a monomolecular, oligomeric, or polymeric compound. ;[0098]    As the alcohol compound, an oil-modified alcohol compound may also be used. The term oil-modified alcohol compound means a compound containing one hydroxy group per molecule and at the same time containing at least one oil group, i.e., a linear or branched hydrocarbon group having 3 or more carbon atoms at its terminal. Here, the method for confirming the number of hydroxyl groups and the number of hydrocarbon groups is the same as that of the polyol compound. Such an alcohol compound may be a monomolecular, oligomeric, or polymeric compound. As such an oil-modified alcohol compound is applied together with the above-described oil-modified polyol compound to be formed as a polyurethane material, it is possible to secure low adhesion force to a specific material while using an adhesion force reducing component such as a plasticizer or minimizing the used amount. ;[0099]    The oil-modified alcohol compound may have a form similar to that of the oil-modified polyol compound, except that it contains one hydroxyl group per molecule. Therefore, the description of the oil-modified polyol compound may be equally applied to the oil-modified alcohol compound. ;[0100]    That is, for example, the lower limit of the number of carbon atoms in the linear or branched hydrocarbon group present in the oil-modified alcohol compound may be 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, or 17 or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11 or 10 or so. The number of carbon atoms may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0101]    The linear or branched hydrocarbon group may or may not contain double bonds. In the case of including the double bonds, such double bonds may be conjugated double bonds or cis double bonds. ;[0102]    A specific type of the hydrocarbon group may be exemplified by an alkyl group, an alkenyl group, or an alkynyl group. In one example, the hydrocarbon group may be linked to the alcohol compound via a carbonyl group or a carbonyloxy group, and in this case, the hydrocarbon group may be an alkylcarbonyl group, an alkenylcarbonyl group, an alkynylcarbonyl group, an alkylcarbonyloxy group, an alkenylcarbonyloxy group, or an alkynylcarbonyloxy group. ;[0103]    The lower limit of the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group, alkenyl group or alkynyl group may be 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, or 17 or so, and the upper limit thereof may be 50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11 or 10 or so. The number of carbon atoms may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0104]    The alkyl group, alkenyl group, or alkynyl group may be linear or branched, and may be optionally substituted with one or more substituents. When the substituent is present, the type of the substituent is not particularly limited, and for example, a halogen atom such as fluorine may be exemplified as the substituent. ;[0105]    In one example, the hydrocarbon of the oil-modified alcohol compound may also be included in the substituent of Formula 1 above. In this instance, the detailed matters of the substituent of Formula 1 are also the same as in the case of the oil-modified polyol compound. ;[0106]    The number of hydrocarbon groups included in the alcohol compound is not particularly limited, but in one example, the lower limit of the number of hydrocarbon groups included in the alcohol compound may be 1 or 2 or so per molecule, and the upper limit thereof may also be 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 or 2 or so per molecule. The number of carbon atoms may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0107]    The alcohol compound may have various forms if it includes the hydroxy group and the hydrocarbon group. ;[0108]    In one example, the alcohol compound may be a compound in the form that at least some of hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon compound such as an alkane, alkene or alkyne are substituted with the hydroxy groups and/or the hydrocarbon groups. The number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon compound such as the alkane, alkene or alkyne may be, for example, 1 to 20, 1 to 16, 1 to 8, or 4 to 6. ;[0109]    Such a hydrocarbon compound such as the alkane, alkene or alkyne may be linear, branched, or cyclic. In addition, the hydroxyl groups and/or hydrocarbon groups in the alkane, alkene, or alkyne may be substituted on the same carbon atom, or may also be substituted on different carbon atoms. ;[0110]    In another example, the alcohol compound may be a compound having a polyester skeleton or a polyether skeleton. In this case, the alcohol compound may be an oligomeric compound or a polymeric compound. ;[0111]    Like the case of the polyol compound, the polyester skeleton may be a so-called polycaprolactone skeleton, and the polyether skeleton may be a so-called polyalkylene skeleton. ;[0112]    In one example, the polyester skeleton may be a skeleton having a repeating unit represented by Formula 2 above. In this instance, the specific contents of the repeating unit of Formula 2 are the same as those of the polyol compound. ;[0113]    Therefore, even in the case of the oil-modified alcohol compound, the hydroxy group or the above-described hydrocarbon group in the alcohol compound having the skeleton of Formula 2 above may be present at the terminal of the skeleton of Formula 2 above, and in this case, the skeleton of Formula 2 above may be represented by Formula 3 above. In this instance, the specific contents of the skeleton of Formula 3 are the same as those of the polyol compound. ;[0114]    The lower limit of the number of skeletons of Formula 2 or 3 above in the alcohol compound may be 1 or 2 on the premise that the compound contains one hydroxyl group per molecule, and the upper limit thereof may be 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 or 2 or so. The number of skeletons may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0115]    The alcohol compound having the polyester skeleton may also have a linear or branched structure. ;[0116]    Here, the linear structure is a structure in which a main chain including a skeleton of Formula 2 or 3 above is present and no other polymer chain is linked to the main chain, and the branched structure may be in a form that as a side chain, a chain including a skeleton of Formula 2 or 3 above is bonded to the main chain including a skeleton of Formula 2 or 3 above. Here, in the branched structure, the number of chains including the skeleton of Formula 2 or 3 above linked as the side chain may be, for example, 1 to 5, 1 to 4, 1 to 3, 1 to 2, or 1. ;[0117]    In one example, the alcohol compound having a polyester skeleton may also be a compound in the form that at least some of hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon compound such as an alkane, alkene or alkyne are substituted with the hydroxyl group and/or the skeleton of Formula 3 above. The number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon compound such as the alkane, alkene or alkyne may be, for example, 1 to 20, 1 to 16, 1 to 8, or 4 to 6. ;[0118]    Such a hydrocarbon compound such as the alkane, alkene or alkyne may be linear, branched, or cyclic. In addition, the hydroxyl group and/or the skeleton of Formula 3 may be substituted on the same carbon atom in the alkane, alkene, or alkyne, or may also be substituted on different carbon atoms. ;[0119]    In one example, the polyether skeleton of the alcohol compound may also be a skeleton having a repeating unit represented by Formula 5 above. In this instance, the specific contents of Formula 5 are the same as those of the polyol compound. ;[0120]    Even in an alcohol compound having a skeleton of Formula 5, the hydroxy group or the above-described hydrocarbon group may be present at the terminal of the skeleton of Formula 5 above, which may be a skeleton of Formula 6. In this instance, the specific contents of Formula 6 are the same as those of the polyol compound. ;[0121]    The lower limit of the number of skeletons of Formula 5 or 6 above included in the alcohol compound may be about 1 or 2 or so on the premise that the alcohol compound has one hydroxyl group per molecule, and the upper limit thereof may be 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 or 2 or so. The number of skeletons may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0122]    The alcohol compound having a polyether skeleton may have a linear or branched structure. ;[0123]    Here, the linear structure may be a structure in which a main chain including a skeleton of Formula 5 or 6 above is present and no other polymer chain is linked to the main chain, and the branched structure may be in a form that as a side chain, a chain including a skeleton of Formula 5 or 6 above is bonded to a main chain including a skeleton of Formula 5 or 6 above. Here, in the branched structure, the number of chains containing the skeleton of Formula 5 or 6 above linked as side chains may be, for example, 1 to 5, 1 to 4, 1 to 3, 1 to 2, or 1. ;[0124]    In one example, the alcohol compound having the polyether skeleton may be a compound in the form that at least some of hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon compound such as an alkane, alkene or alkyne are substituted with a hydroxyl group and/or a skeleton of Formula 5 above. The number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon compound such as the alkane, alkene or alkyne may be, for example, 1 to 20, 1 to 16, 1 to 8, or 4 to 6. ;[0125]    Such a hydrocarbon compound such as the alkane, alkene or alkyne may be linear, branched, or cyclic. In addition, the hydroxy group and/or the skeleton of Formula 5 may be substituted on the same carbon atom in the alkane, alkene, or alkyne, or may also be substituted on different carbon atoms. ;[0126]    When the above-described alcohol compound is an oligomeric or polymeric compound, the relevant compound may have an appropriate level of molecular weight. ;[0127]    For example, the lower limit of the weight average molecular weight of the oligomeric or polymeric alcohol compound may be 10 g/mol, 200 g/mol, 300 g/mol, 400 g/mol, 500 g/mol, 600 g/mol, 700 g/mol, 800 g/mol, 900 g/mol, 1000 g/mol, 1200 g/mol, 1400 g/mol, 1600 g/mol or 1800 g/mol or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 5000 g/mol, 4500 g/mol, 4000 g/mol, 3500 g/mol, 3000 g/mol, 2500 g/mol, 2000 g/mol, 1500 g/mol, 1000 g/mol or 800 g/mol or so. The weight average molecular weight may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0128]    By applying the oil-modified polyol as described above, it is possible to more effectively secure desired physical properties. ;[0129]    The lower limit of the content of the oil-modified alcohol compound relative to 100 parts by weight of the oil-modified polyol compound may be 10 parts by weight, 20 parts by weight, 30 parts by weight, 40 parts by weight, 50 parts by weight, 60 parts by weight, 70 parts by weight, 80 parts by weight, 90 parts by weight, 100 parts by weight, 110 parts by weight, 120 parts by weight, 130 parts by weight, 140 parts by weight, 150 parts by weight, 160 parts by weight, 170 parts by weight, 180 parts by weight, 190 parts by weight, 200 parts by weight, 210 parts by weight, 220 parts by weight, 230 parts by weight, 240 parts by weight, 250 parts by weight, 260 parts by weight, 270 parts by weight, 280 parts by weight, 290 parts by weight or 300 parts by weight or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 1,000 parts by weight, 950 parts by weight, 900 parts by weight, 850 parts by weight, 800 parts by weight, 750 parts by weight, 700 parts by weight, 650 parts by weight, 600 parts by weight, 550 parts by weight, 500 parts by weight, 450 parts by weight, 400 parts by weight, 350 parts by weight, 300 parts by weight, 250 parts by weight, 200 parts by weight, 150 parts by weight, 100 parts by weight, 90 parts by weight, 80 parts by weight, 70 parts by weight or 60 parts by weight or so. The ratio may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0130]    The ratio of the oil-modified polyol compound may be changed in consideration of the overall composition or desired physical properties of the resin composition. ;[0131]    Among the polyol components in the hydroxy functional component, a component comprising only the oil-modified polyol compound and the oil-modified alcohol compound may be referred to as an oil-modified component. In this case, the lower limit of the entire weight average molecular weight of such an oil-modified component may be 10 g/mol, 200g/mol, 300 g/mol, 400 g/mol, 500 g/mol, 600 g/mol, 700 g/mol, 800 g/mol, 900 g/mol, 1000 g/mol, 1200 g/mol, 1400 g/mol, 1600 g/mol or 1800 g/mol or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 5,000 g/mol, 4500 g/mol, 4000 g/mol, 3500 g/mol, 3000 g/mol, 2500 g/mol, 2000 g/mol, 1500 g/mol, 1000 g/mol or 800 g/mol or so. The weight average molecular weight may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0132]    The oil-modified polyol compound or alcohol compound may be synthesized through a known synthesis method. That is, the compounds may be prepared by reacting a compound capable of introducing the hydrocarbon group corresponding to the oil-modified portion with a known polyol compound. At this time, the compound capable of introducing the hydrocarbon group may be exemplified by saturated or unsaturated fatty acids, and specifically, may be exemplified by butyric acid, caproic acid, 2-ethylhexanoic acid, caprylic acid, isononanoic acid, capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, or oleic acid, and the like, but is not limited thereto. In the above process, by adjusting the reaction ratio of the fatty acid and the polyol compound, a mixture (oil-modified component) comprising the polyol compound and the alcohol compound may also be optionally prepared. ;[0133]    In addition, the type of polyol compound reacting with the saturated or unsaturated fatty acid is not particularly limited, and for example, an appropriate type of general polyol compounds to be described below may be applied, but is not limited thereto. ;[0134]    The resin composition may further comprise a polyol compound different from the oil-modified polyol compound as the polyol compound. In this case, the polyol compound does not contain the above-described oil group, that is, the linear or branched hydrocarbon group having 3 or more carbon atoms. For convenience, such a polyol compound may be referred to as a general polyol compound in this specification. ;[0135]    The lower limit of the number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon group that the general polyol compound does not contain may be 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, or 17 or so, and the upper limit thereof may be 50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11 or 10 or so. The number of carbon atoms may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. In one example, the hydrocarbon group may be an alkyl group, an alkenyl group, or an alkynyl group having the number of carbon atoms. ;[0136]    The general polyol compound may contain two or more hydroxy groups per molecule, and such a polyol compound may be a monomolecular, oligomeric, or polymeric compound. The number of hydroxy groups included in the general polyol compound is not particularly limited, but in one example, the lower limit of the number of hydroxy groups included in the general polyol compound may be 2 or 3 or so per molecule, and the lower limit thereof may also be 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 or 2 or so per molecule. The number of hydroxy groups may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0137]    The general polyol compound may have various forms. ;[0138]    In one example, the general polyol compound may be a polyester polyol. As the polyester polyol, for example, a so-called carboxylic acid polyol or caprolactone polyol may be used. ;[0139]    In one example, the polyester polyol may be a skeleton having a repeating unit represented by Formula 8 below.\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8c8f92b9-616d-46b7-9113-89d48615c068-ib0009\" />\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8c8f92b9-616d-46b7-9113-89d48615c068-ib0010\" />;\n[0140]    In Formula 8, X7 and X8 are each independently a single bond or an oxygen atom, L3 may be an alkylene group, and p is an arbitrary number. ;[0141]    In Formula 8 above, the alkylene group may be, in one example, an alkylene group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, 4 to 20 carbon atoms, 4 to 16 carbon atoms, 4 to 12 carbon atoms, or 4 to 8 carbon atoms, which may be linear or branched. ;[0142]    When the polyester polyol is a polycaprolactone polyol, L3 of Formula 8 above may be a linear alkylene group with 5 carbon atoms. ;[0143]    Also, in Formula 8 above, p is an arbitrary number representing the number of repeating units, which may be, for example, a number within the range of 1 to 25. ;[0144]    The lower limit of p in Formula 8 above may be 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21 or 23 or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 25, 23, 21, 19, 17, 15, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5 or 3 or so. The p may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0145]    The polyester polyol having the skeleton of Formula 8 above may be a so-called carboxylic acid polyol or caprolactone polyol. Such a polyol compound may be formed by a known method, and for example, the carboxylic acid polyol may be formed by reacting a component including a carboxylic acid and a polyol (e.g., diol or triol, etc.), and the caprolactone polyol may be formed by reacting a component including caprolactone and a polyol (e.g., diol or triol, etc.). The carboxylic acid may be a dicarboxylic acid. ;[0146]    In the polyol compound having the skeleton of Formula 8 above, the hydroxyl group may be present at the terminal of the skeleton of Formula 8 above or at another site of the polyester polyol. ;[0147]    The lower limit of the number of skeletons of Formula 8 above included in the general polyol compound may be 1 or 2, and the upper limit thereof may be 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 or so. The number of skeletons may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0148]    The polyol compound having a polyester skeleton may have a linear or branched structure. ;[0149]    Here, the linear structure may be a structure in which a main chain including the skeleton of Formula 8 above is present and no other polymer chain is linked to the main chain, and the branched structure may be in a form that as side chains, chains including the skeleton of Formula 8 above are bonded to a main chain including the skeleton of Formula 8 above. In the branched structure, the number of chains containing the skeleton of Formula 8 above linked as the side chains may be, for example, 1 to 5, 1 to 4, 1 to 3, 1 to 2, or 1. ;[0150]    In another example, a polyol having an alkane diol unit, a polyol unit, and a dicarboxylic acid unit may also be used as the general polyol compound. Such a polyol may be a mixture of the above alkane diol, polyol and dicarboxylic acid, or a reactant thereof. At this time, the alkane diol may be exemplified by a diol compound with 1 to 20 carbon atoms, 4 to 20 carbon atoms, 4 to 16 carbon atoms, or 4 to 12 carbon atoms, such as 3-methyl-1,5-pentanediol, 1,9-nonanediol or 1,6-hexanediol. In addition, the polyol may be exemplified by an alkane with 1 to 20 carbon atoms, 4 to 20 carbon atoms, 4 to 16 carbon atoms or 4 to 12 carbon atoms substituted with 3 to 10, 3 to 9, 3 to 8, 3 to 7, 3 to 6, 3 to 5, or 3 to 4 hydroxyl groups, such as trimethylolpropane. In addition, the dicarboxylic acid may be exemplified by adipic acid, terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, or sebacic acid, and the like. The polyol compound of this kind is known as, for example, product names of Kuraray's P-510, P-1010, P-2010, P-3010, P-4010, P-5010, P-6010, F-510, F-1010, F- 2010, F-3010, P-2011, P-520, P-2020, P-1012, P-2012, P-630, P-2030, P-2050, or N-2010, and the like. ;[0151]    As the general polyol, a polyol having a weight average molecular weight in a range of 100 g/mol to 5,000 g/mol may be used. The desired effect can be more effectively achieved through the application of such a polyol. ;[0152]    When the general polyol compound is included, the lower limit of the weight ratio of the general polyol compound relative to 100 parts by weight of the oil-modified polyol compound may be 1 part by weight, 3 parts by weight, 5 parts by weight, 7 parts by weight, 10 parts by weight, 15 parts by weight, 20 parts by weight, 25 parts by weight, 30 parts by weight, 35 parts by weight, 40 parts by weight, 45 parts by weight, 50 parts by weight, 55 parts by weight, 60 parts by weight, 65 parts by weight, 70 parts by weight, 75 parts by weight, 80 parts by weight, 85 parts by weight, 90 parts by weight, 95 parts by weight or 100 parts by weight or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 200 parts by weight, 190 parts by weight, 180 parts by weight, 170 parts by weight, 160 parts by weight, 150 parts by weight, 140 parts by weight, 130 parts by weight, 120 parts by weight, 110 parts by weight, 100 parts by weight, 90 parts by weight, 80 parts by weight, 70 parts by weight, 60 parts by weight, 50 parts by weight, 40 parts by weight, 30 parts by weight, 20 parts by weight or 10 parts by weight or so. The ratio may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0153]    In another example, when the general polyol compound is included, the lower limit of the content ratio of the general polyol compound relative to 100 parts by weight of the sum of the oil-modified polyol and the oil-modified alcohol may be 1 part by weight, 5 parts by weight, 10 parts by weight, 15 parts by weight, 20 parts by weight, 25 parts by weight, 30 parts by weight, 35 parts by weight or 40 parts by weight or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 200 parts by weight, 190 parts by weight, 180 parts by weight, 170 parts by weight, 160 parts by weight, 150 parts by weight, 140 parts by weight, 130 parts by weight, 120 parts by weight, 110 parts by weight, 100 parts by weight, 90 parts by weight, 80 parts by weight, 70 parts by weight, 60 parts by weight, 50 parts by weight, 40 parts by weight, 30 parts by weight, 20 parts by weight or 10 parts by weight or so. The ratio may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0154]    The ratio may be changed in consideration of the composition or intended use of the entire resin composition. ;[0155]    The resin composition may comprise, as an additional component, a curing agent that reacts with the polyol compound and/or alcohol compound. ;[0156]    As the curing agent, various types may be applied, but when the resin composition is the polyurethane composition, a polyisocyanate may be applied as the curing agent. The term polyisocyanate means a compound having two or more isocyanate groups. The lower limit of the number of isocyanate groups in the polyisocyanate may be 2 or 3 or so, and the upper limit thereof may be 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 or 2 or so. The number of the isocyanate groups may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0157]    The type of polyisocyanate used as the curing agent is not particularly limited, but a non-aromatic polyisocyanate containing no aromatic group may be used to secure desired physical properties. ;[0158]    As the polyisocyanate compound, for example, aliphatic polyisocyanates such as hexamethylene diisocyanate, trimethylhexamethylene diisocyanate, lysine diisocyanate, norbornane diisocyanate methyl, ethylene diisocyanate, propylene diisocyanate, or tetramethylene diisocyanate; alicyclic polyisocyanates such as transcyclohexane-1,4-diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, bis(isocyanatemethyl)cyclohexane diisocyanate, or dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate; or one or more carbodiimide-modified polyisocyanates or isocyanurate-modified polyisocyanates of the foregoing, and the like may be used. In addition, as the polyisocyanate, addition reaction products of the diisocyanate and polyol (for example, trimethylol propane, etc.) as described above may also be used. Furthermore, a mixture of two or more of the above-listed compounds may be used. ;[0159]    The application rate of the polyisocyanate may be adjusted in consideration of the number of hydroxy groups present in the hydroxy functional component included in the resin composition, and physical properties after curing. ;[0160]    For example, the polyisocyanate may be included in the resin composition so that an equivalent ratio (OH/NCO) of the number (OH) of hydroxy groups present in the hydroxy functional component present in the resin composition to the number (NCO) of isocyanate groups present in the polyisocyanate (NCO)may be within a range of 50 to 1,000. ;[0161]    A method for calculating the equivalence ratio (OH/NCO) is known. ;[0162]    For example, if the resin composition is a two-component type, the hydroxy functional component is included in the main part, and the polyisocyanate is included in the curing agent part, the equivalent ratio OH/NCO can be calculated according to the following general equation 1. Equivalent Ratio OH / NCO = D 1 × ∑ W 1 × OH % D 2 × ∑ W 2 × NCO % × DN DO\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"8c8f92b9-616d-46b7-9113-89d48615c068-ib0011\" />;\n[0163]    In General Equation 1, D1 is the density of the main part, D2 is the density of the curing agent part, Wi is the weight ratio of the polyol compound or alcohol compound present in the main part, OH% is the ratio of hydroxy groups included in the polyol compound or alcohol compound having the weight ratio of W1, W2 is the weight ratio of polyisocyanate present in the curing agent part, NCO% is the ratio of isocyanate groups included in the polyisocyanate having the weight ratio of W2, DN is 42Da as the dalton mass of the isocyanate group, and DO is 17 Da as the dalton mass of the hydroxy group. ;[0164]    The Wi is the weight% (based on the total weight of the main part) in the main part of each polyol compound or alcohol compound present in the main part, and OH% of the relevant compound is the % of the hydroxy group included in 1 mole of each polyol compound or alcohol compound, which is obtained by dividing the product of the molar number of hydroxy groups included in a single polyol compound or alcohol compound and the molar mass of the hydroxy group by the molar mass of the single polyol compound or alcohol compound and then multiplying by 100. ;[0165]    Here, W2 is the weight% (based on the total weight of the curing agent part) in the curing agent part of each polyisocyanate present in the curing agent part, and NCO% of the relevant compound is the % of the NCO group included in 1 mole of each polyisocyanate compound, which is obtained by dividing the product of the molar number of NCO groups included in a single polyisocyanate compound and the molar mass of the NCO group by the molar mass of the single polyisocyanate compound and then multiplying by 100. ;[0166]    Also, in General Equation 1 above, the dalton mass is a constant. ;[0167]    The lower limit of the equivalent ratio (OH/NCO) may be 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250 or 260 or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 1000, 900, 800, 700, 600, 500, 400, 300, 290, 280, 270, 260, 250, 240, 230, 220, 210, 200, 190, 180, 170, 160, 150, 140, 130, 120, 110 or 100 or so. The equivalent ratio may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, or may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0168]    The resin composition may further comprise a filler component. The term filler component means a component composed of a filler, that is, a component comprising only a filler. ;[0169]    In one example, the filler component may comprise two or more fillers having different average particle diameters. In one example, the filler component may comprise three or more fillers having different average particle diameters, or may be composed of three to six, three to five, three to four, or three fillers, having different average particle diameters. That is, in one example, the filler component may also comprise only three to six, three to five, three to four, or three fillers, having different average particle diameters. ;[0170]    In another example, the filler component may exhibit at least two peaks in a volume curve of a particle size distribution measured using laser diffraction. In one example, the filler component may exhibit three or more peaks in the volume curve of the particle size distribution, or may exhibit three to six, three to five, three to four, or three peaks. For example, in the range of the filler component exhibiting three peaks, the filler component exhibiting one, two, or four or more peaks is not included. ;[0171]    The average particle diameter in the filler of the present application means a particle diameter at which the volume accumulation becomes 50% in the volume curve of the particle size distribution measured by laser diffraction, which may also be referred to as a median diameter. That is, in the present application, the particle size distribution is obtained on a volume basis through the laser diffraction, and the particle diameter at the point where the cumulative value becomes 50% in the cumulative curve with 100% of the total volume is set as the average particle diameter, and in another example, such an average particle diameter may be referred to as a median particle size or a D50 particle diameter. ;[0172]    Therefore, here, the two fillers having different average particle diameters may mean fillers having different particle diameters at the point where the cumulative value becomes 50% in the volume curve of the particle size distribution. ;[0173]    When two or more fillers having different average particle diameters are usually mixed in order to form a filler component, as many peaks as the types of mixed fillers appear on the volume curve of the particle size distribution measured using laser diffraction with respect to the filler component. Therefore, for example, when three fillers having different average particle diameters are mixed to constitute a filler component, the volume curve of the particle size distribution measured using the laser diffraction regarding the filler component shows three peaks. ;[0174]    The filler component of the resin composition of the present application may be a thermally conductive filler component. The term thermally conductive filler component means a filler component functioning so that the resin composition or the cured body thereof exhibits the above-described thermal conductivity. ;[0175]    In one example, the filler component may comprise at least a first filler having an average particle diameter of 60 µm to 200 µm, a second filler having an average particle diameter in a range of 10 µm to 30 µm, and a third filler having an average particle diameter of 5 µm or less. ;[0176]    The lower limit of the average particle diameter of the first filler may be 62 µm, 62 µm, 64 µm, 66 µm or 68 µm or so, and the upper limit thereof may be 200 µm, 195 µm, 190 µm, 185 µm, 180 µm, 175 µm, 170 µm, 165 µm, 160 µm, 155 µm, 150 µm, 145 µm, 140 µm, 135 µm, 130 µm, 125 µm, about 120 µm, 115 µm, 110 µm, 105 µm, 100 µm, 95 µm, 90 µm, 85 µm, 80 µm or about 75 µm or so. The average particle diameter of the first filler may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0177]    The lower limit of the average particle diameter of the second filler may be 10 µm, 12 µm, 13 µm, 14 µm, 15 µm, 16 µm, 17 µm, 18 µm, 19 µm, or 20 µm or so, and the upper limit thereof may be 29 µm, 28 µm, 27 µm, 26 µm, 25 µm, 24 µm, 23 µm, 22 µm, 21 µm or about 20 µm or so. The average particle diameter of the second filler may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0178]    The lower limit of the third filler may be 0.01 µm, 0.1 µm, about 0.5 µm, 1 µm, 1.5 µm, or 2 µm or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 5 µm, 4.5 µm, about 4 µm, 3.5 µm, 3 µm, 2.5 µm or 2 µm or so. The average particle diameter of the third filler may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0179]    The ratio (D1/D3) of the average particle diameter (D1) of the first filler to the average particle diameter (D3) of the third filler in the filler component may be in a range of 25 to 300. ;[0180]    In one example, the third filler may be a filler having the smallest average particle diameter among fillers included in the filler component when the filler component comprises two or more fillers having different average particle diameters, and the first filler may be a filler having the largest average particle diameter among fillers included in the filler component when the filler component comprises two or more fillers having different average particle diameters. In such a state, the particle diameter ratio may be satisfied. ;[0181]    The lower limit of the ratio (D1/D3) may be 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230 or 235 or so, and the upper limit thereof may be 300, 290, 280, 270, 260, 250, 240, 220, 200, 180, 160, 140, 120, 100, 95, 90, 85, 80, 75, 70, 65 or 60 or so. The ratio may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0182]    In the filler component, the lower limit of the ratio (D1/D2) of the average particle diameter (D1) of the first filler to the average particle diameter (D2) of the second filler may be 3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, or 3.5 or so, or may also be 20, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 or 4 or so. The ratio may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0183]    As the filler, for example, a ceramic material such as aluminum oxide (alumina: Al2O3), aluminum nitride (AlN), boron nitride (BN), silicon nitride (Si3N4), silicon carbide (SiC), beryllium oxide (BeO), zinc oxide (ZnO), magnesium oxide (MgO), aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3), magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2), calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and/or boehmite may be used. Such a filler is advantageous in satisfying the thermal conductivity within the above-mentioned range, and additionally, the above-described insulation properties and the like may also be satisfied through the application of a ceramic filler. ;[0184]    The upper limit of the proportion of the filler component in the resin composition may be 99 wt%, 98 wt%, 97 wt%, 96 wt%, 95 wt%, 94.5 wt%, 94 wt%, 93.5 wt%, 93 wt%, 92.5 wt%, 92 wt%, 91.5 wt%, 91 wt%, 90.5 wt%, 90.0 wt%, 89.5 wt%, 89.0 wt%, 88.5 wt% or 88.0 wt% or so, and the lower limit thereof may be about 70 wt%, 71 wt%, 72 wt%, 73 wt%, 74 wt%, about 75 wt%, 76 wt%, 77 wt%, 78 wt%, 79 wt%, 80 wt%, 81 wt%, 82 wt%, 83 wt%, 84 wt%, 85 wt%, 86 wt%, 87 wt% or 88 wt% or so. The ratio may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0185]    When the resin composition is a one-component resin composition, the content of the filler component may be a ratio based on the total weight of the relevant resin composition, and in the case of a two-component resin composition, it may be a ratio based on the combined weight of the main part and the curing agent part of the two-component resin composition, or may be a ratio based on the total weight of the main part or the curing agent part alone. ;[0186]    When the resin composition is composed of the two-component resin composition, it may be appropriate that the filler component to be applied to the final cured body as the filler component is divided in substantially equal amounts and introduced into the main and curing agent parts, respectively. ;[0187]    The filler component may comprise various types of fillers, if necessary, in addition to the thermally conductive filler, and for example, a carbon filler such as graphite, fumed silica, or clay, and the like may be applied. ;[0188]    The resin composition may further comprise necessary components in addition to the above-described components. ;[0189]    In one example, the resin composition may further comprise a plasticizer. As described above, in the present application, it is possible to secure low adhesion force to a specific material without applying a plasticizer, but a small amount of plasticizer may also be applied if necessary. ;[0190]    The type of the applicable plasticizer is not particularly limited, and for example, a phthalate-based plasticizer such as dioctyl phthalate (DOP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP), diisononyl phthalate (DINP) or polyethylene terephthalate (PET), an adipate-based plasticizer such as dioctyl adipate (DOA) or diisononyl adipate (DINA), a fatty acid-based plasticizer, a phosphoric acid-based plasticizer, or a polyester-based plasticizer, and the like may be applied. ;[0191]    When the plasticizer is included, the ratio may be adjusted according to the purpose. For example, when the plasticizer is included, the lower limit of the weight ratio of the plasticizer relative to 100 parts by weight of the oil-modified polyol compound may be 0.5 parts by weight, 1.5 parts by weight, 2 parts by weight, 3 parts by weight, 4 parts by weight, 5 parts by weight, 6 parts by weight, 7 parts by weight, 8 parts by weight, 9 parts by weight, 10 parts by weight, 15 parts by weight, 20 parts by weight, 25 parts by weight, 30 parts by weight, 35 parts by weight, 40 parts by weight, 45 parts by weight, 50 parts by weight, 100 parts by weight, 150 parts by weight, 200 parts by weight, 250 parts by weight or 300 parts by weight or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 500 parts by weight, 450 parts by weight, 400 parts by weight, 350 parts by weight, 300 parts by weight, 250 parts by weight, 200 parts by weight, 150 parts by weight, 100 parts by weight, 90 parts by weight, 80 parts by weight, 70 parts by weight, 60 parts by weight, 50 parts by weight, 40 parts by weight, 30 parts by weight, 20 parts by weight, 19 parts by weight, 18 parts by weight, 17 parts by weight, 16 parts by weight, 15 parts by weight, 14 parts by weight, 13 parts by weight, 12 parts by weight, 11 parts by weight, 10 parts by weight, 9 parts by weight, 8 parts by weight, 7 parts by weight, 6 parts by weight, 5 parts by weight, 4 parts by weight, 3 parts by weight, 2 parts by weight or 1 part by weight or so. The ratio may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0192]    In another example, when the plasticizer is included, the lower limit of the ratio of the plasticizer relative to 100 parts by weight of the sum (oil-modified component) of the oil-modified polyol and the oil-modified alcohol may be 0.5 parts by weight, 1.5 parts by weight, 2 parts by weight, 5 parts by weight, 10 parts by weight, 15 parts by weight, 20 parts by weight, 25 parts by weight, 30 parts by weight, 50 parts by weight, 60 parts by weight, 70 parts by weight, 80 parts by weight, 90 parts by weight, 100 parts by weight, 110 parts by weight, 120 parts by weight, 130 parts by weight or 140 parts by weight or so, and the upper limit thereof may also be 400 parts by weight, 350 parts by weight, 300 parts by weight, 250 parts by weight, 200 parts by weight, 150 parts by weight, 100 parts by weight, 90 parts by weight, 80 parts by weight, 70 parts by weight, 60 parts by weight, 50 parts by weight, 40 parts by weight, 30 parts by weight, 20 parts by weight, 19 parts by weight, 18 parts by weight, 17 parts by weight, 16 parts by weight, 15 parts by weight, 14 parts by weight, 13 parts by weight, 12 parts by weight, 11 parts by weight, 10 parts by weight, 9 parts by weight, 8 parts by weight, 7 parts by weight, 6 parts by weight, 5 parts by weight, 4 parts by weight, 3 parts by weight, 2 parts by weight or 1 part by weight or so. The ratio may be less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits, may be more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits, or may be within a range of less than or equal to, or less than any one of the above-described upper limits while being more than or equal to, or more than any one of the above-described lower limits. ;[0193]    The ratio may also be changed in consideration of the composition or intended use of the entire resin composition. ;[0194]    In addition to the above components, the resin composition may comprise additional components as needed. It may further comprise, as an example of additional components, a catalyst that assists or accelerates the curing reaction, a viscosity modifier (e.g., thixotropy imparting agent, diluent, etc.) for increasing or decreasing the viscosity, or for adjusting the viscosity according to shear force, a dispersing agent, a surface treatment agent, or a coupling agent, and the like. ;[0195]    The resin composition may further include a flame retardant or a flame-retardant adjuvant. In this case, a known flame retardant may be used without special limitation, and for example, a solid filler type flame retardant or a liquid flame retardant may be applied. ;[0196]    The flame retardant includes, for example, an organic flame retardant such as melamine cyanurate or an inorganic flame retardant such as magnesium hydroxide, and the like. When the amount of filler filled in the resin layer is large, a liquid type flame retardant material (TEP, triethyl phosphate, or TCPP, tris(1,3-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate, etc.) may also be used. In addition, a silane coupling agent capable of acting as a flame-retardant synergist may also be added. ;[0197]    As described above, the resin composition may be the one-component composition or the two-component composition. In the case of the two-component composition, the above-described respective components of the resin composition may be separately included in the main part and the curing agent part which are physically separated. ;[0198]    In one example, the present application relates to a composition (two-component composition) in which the resin composition is composed of a two-component resin composition. ;[0199]    Such a two-component composition may comprise at least a main part and a curing agent part, where the main and curing agent parts may be physically separated from each other. When the main and curing agent parts thus physically separated are mixed, a curing reaction may be initiated, and as a result, polyurethane may be formed. ;[0200]    In the two-component composition, the main part may comprise at least the hydroxy functional component (particularly, the oil-modified polyol compound), and the curing agent part may comprise at least the polyisocyanate. ;[0201]    When the general polyol compound as described above is included in the resin composition, this compound may be included, for example, in the main part. ;[0202]    In addition, the filler component may be included in any one of the main and curing agent parts, or may be included in both the main and curing agent parts. When the filler component is included in both the main and curing agent parts, the same amount of the filler component may be included in the main and curing agent parts. ;[0203]    The catalyst, plasticizer, flame retardants, and the like as other components may be included in the main and/or curing agent part as needed. ;[0204]    Furthermore, in the two-component composition, a volume ratio (P/N) of the volume (P) of the main part to the volume (N) of the curing agent part may be in a range of about 0.8 to 1.2. ;[0205]    Such a two-component composition or the cured body thereof may also exhibit the adhesion force to aluminum and polyester, thermal conductivity, hardness, curvature radius, insulation, flame retardancy, specific gravity, shrinkage, coefficient of thermal expansion and/or 5% weight loss temperature in a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and the like. ;[0206]    The present application also relates to a product comprising the resin composition or the cured body thereof. The resin composition of the present application or the cured body thereof may be usefully applied as a heat dissipation material. Therefore, the product may comprise a heat-generating component. The term heat-generating component means a component that emits heat during use, and the type is not particularly limited. The representative heat-generating component includes various electric/electronic products comprising battery cells, battery modules, or battery packs, and the like. ;[0207]    The product of the present application may comprise, for example, the heat-generating component and the resin composition (or the two-component composition) or the cured body thereof existing adjacent to the heat-generating component. ;[0208]    A specific method of configuring the product of the present application is not particularly limited, and if the resin composition or the two-component composition of the present application, or the cured body thereof is applied as a heat dissipation material, the product may be configured in various known ways. ;Advantageous Effects;[0209]    In the present application, it is possible to provide a resin composition or a cured body thereof that exhibits low adhesion force to a predetermined adherend while exhibiting high thermal conductivity. Also, in the present application, the low adhesion force can be achieved without using an adhesion force adjusting component such as a plasticizer or in a state where the use ratio thereof is minimized. The present application can also provide a product comprising the curable composition or the cured body thereof. ;Description of Drawings;[0210]    Figures 1  and  2  are analysis results for oil-modified components obtained in Preparation Examples. ;Best Mode;[0211]    Hereinafter, the present application will be specifically described through Examples, but the scope of the present application is not limited by the following examples. ;[0212]    The cured body mentioned below is formed by mixing main and curing agent parts of all resin compositions in Examples, which are prepared in a two-component type, so that the OH/NCO equivalent ratio described in each example is satisfied, and then maintaining the mixture at room temperature for about 24 hours. ;1. Thermal conductivity;[0213]    The thermal conductivity of the resin composition or the cured body thereof was measured by a hot-disk method according to ISO 22007-2 standard. Specifically, mixtures of the main parts and the curing agent parts in a volume ratio of 1:1 in Examples or Comparative Examples composed of a two-component type were each placed in a mold having a thickness of about 7 mm or so, and the thermal conductivity was measured in the through plane direction using the Hot Disk equipment. As stipulated in the above standard (ISO 22007-2), the Hot Disk equipment is an equipment that can check the thermal conductivity by measuring the temperature change (electrical resistance change) while the sensor with the nickel wire double spiral structure is heated, and the thermal conductivity was measured according to this standard. ;2. Measurement of adhesion force to polyester;[0214]    The adhesion force to polyester was evaluated for a specimen prepared by attaching a PET (polyethylene terephthalate) film and an aluminum plate. A film having a width of 10 mm or so and a length of 200 mm or so was used as the PET film, and an aluminum plate having each of a width and a length of 100 mm was used as the aluminum plate. A resin composition was applied to the entire surface of the aluminum plate and maintained at room temperature (about 25°C) for about 24 hours in a state where the PET film was attached on the resin composition to prepare a specimen. At this time, the entire width and 100 mm or so of the length portion in the PET film were attached to the aluminum plate via the resin composition. The adhesion force was measured while the PET film was peeled from the aluminum plate in the longitudinal direction in a state where the aluminum plate of the specimen was fixed. The attachment was performed by applying the resin composition (the mixture of the main part and the curing agent part in a volume ratio of 1:1) to the aluminum plate to have a thickness of about 2 mm or so after curing, and then closely attaching the PET film on the layer of the resin composition, and maintaining them at room temperature (about 25°C) for about 24 hours to cure the resin composition. The peeling was performed at a peel rate of about 0.5 mm/min or so and a peel angle of 180 degrees until the PET film was completely peeled off. ;3. Measurement of adhesion force to aluminum;[0215]    An uncured resin composition (a mixture of a main part and a curing agent part) was coated in the center of an aluminum substrate having horizontal and vertical lengths of 2 cm and 7 cm, respectively, to have a width of 2 cm and a length of 2 cm or so, and an aluminum substrate having horizontal and vertical lengths of 2 cm and 7 cm, respectively, was attached again on the coating layer, and the resin composition was cured by maintaining the state. Here, the two aluminum substrates were attached to form an angle of 90 degrees to each other. Hereinafter, with the upper aluminum substrate fixed, the lower aluminum substrate was pressed at a speed of 0.5 mm/min to measure the force while the lower aluminum substrate was separated, and the adhesion force to aluminum was obtained by dividing the maximum force measured in the process by the area of the specimen. ;[0216]    According to the measurement results, the adhesion force to aluminum was evaluated by the following criteria. ;<Evaluation criteria>;[0217]    \nGood: The adhesion force to aluminum is 0.1 N/mm<2> or less\nAverage: The adhesion force to aluminum is more than 0.1 N/mm<2> and 0.4 N/mm<2> or less\nBad: The adhesion force to aluminum exceeds 0.4 N/mm<2>;4. Hardness measurement;[0218]    The hardness of the cured body of the resin composition was measured according to ASTM D 2240 and JIS K 6253 standards. It was performed using ASKER's durometer hardness device, where the initial hardness was measured by applying a load of 1 Kg or more (about 1.5 Kg) to the surface of the sample (resin layer) in a flat state, and after 15 seconds, the hardness was evaluated by confirming the stabilized measurement value. ;5. Measurement of curvature radius;[0219]    The curvature radius of the cured body was evaluated using a cured body having a width, a length, and a thickness of 1cm, 10cm, and 2mm, respectively. When the cured body is attached to cylinders having various radii and bent along the longitudinal direction, the curvature radius is the minimum radius of the cylinder at which cracks do not occur in the cured body. ;6. Measurement of weight average molecular weight;[0220]    The weight average molecular weight (Mw) was measured using GPC (Gel permeation chromatography). Specifically, the weight average molecular weight (Mw) can be measured by adding a sample to be analyzed into a 5 mL vial, diluting it with a THF (tetrahydrofuran) solvent to a concentration of about 1 mg/mL, and then filtering a standard sample for calibration and the analysis sample through a syringe filter (pore size: 0.45 µm). Agilent technologies' ChemStation is used as an analysis program, and the weight average molecular weight (Mw) can be obtained by comparing the elution time of the sample with the calibration curve. ;[0221]    <GPC measurement conditions>\nInstrument: Agilent technologies' 1200 series\nColumn: using Agilent technologies' TL Mix.

A catalyst (tin (II) 2-ethylhexanoate (Sigma-Aldrich)) was added to the mixture in an amount of about 0.5 parts by weight relative to 100 parts by weight of the total, and stirred and maintained at 150°C for 30 minutes under an inert gas purge condition. Subsequently, a small amount of xylene as an azeotropic solution was introduced thereto, the temperature was raised to 190°C, and the mixture was reacted for 15 hours or more, and the pressure was reduced to 40 Torr or less for 2 hours or more to remove xylene and unreacted substances.

The use of such adhesive prevented minor delamination and was viable for 10 attempted uses in a subsequent trial. The enclosure gave weight to the device and prevented errant movement with patient volatility, and delamination was minimized by sizing the enclosure to be larger than the area covered by the adhesive treated sensor.\n<tb>Motion artifact<SEP>Normal and abnormal patient movement in an initial study resulted in aberrations in captured heat data.<SEP>AFC cables present a likely source of motion related noise. The wireless iteration of the device combined with subtraction algorithms and a narrowed accepted data range (given the obtained sample and future data) have and will continue to refine and eliminate this artifact.\n<tb>Ease of handling<SEP>The initial trial saw a great deal of difficulty in device handling for the surgeon. Due to the adhesive involved, manipulation with gloved fingers was difficult. Excess traction put on the device and its elements led to poor performance both in terms of lamination and noise artifact engendered.<SEP>The device enclosure ideated resulted in a PDMS device frame designed to aid handling by the diagnostician. This not only reduced glove related device manipulation but facilitated swift application minimizing patient discomfort. Devices were more robust and performed admirably through periods of over 10 trials.\n<tb>Alignment<SEP>Precise alignment of the sensor to the skin overlying tunneled distal shunt catheter was occasionally difficult when attempting to approximate its center.<SEP>Winged attachments and central lines on the enclosure were designed on subsequent device iterations. These improved most applications from multiple attempts at placement to initial success in all subsequent trials. The winged attachments also had an unintended benefit to device handling.\n<tb>Vasculature<SEP>Patients with prominent clavicular veins and superficial arterial branches adjacent to underlying shunt tubing were suspected of possible contamination.<SEP>Benchtop experiments simulated flow rates in shunts, venous and arterial systems with varying flow experiments were conducted with a fluid injector into multiple caliber tubes.\n<tb>Skin thickness<SEP>The depth of tunneled distal shunt catheters was suspected to differ among patients with varying habituses.<SEP>Benchtop experiments, radiographic data and the academic literature were consulted in the resolution of this important question. Anecdotally, over 10 surgeons stated that based on feel and experience alone, shunt catheters were likely 1-8 mm under the skin. Further experiments demonstrated sensor performance to a depth of 6 mm. Measurements shunt catheter to surface distance of available computerized tomography scans of patients was also performed, with an average total thickness of subcutaneous tissue overlying the distal catheter of 1.52 mm. Finally, a comprehensive literature search was performed.

In China, every year more than 500 thousand patients wait for liver transplantation while several hundreds to about one thousand liver sources can be used for liver transplantation. The limited number of liver sources is far from meeting a huge and urgent clinical requirement. Existing clinical treatments and preclinical researches have shown that both bioartificial liver dialysis and hepatocyte transplantation contribute to the improvement of livers and general microenvironments and physiological conditions and contribute to liver repair and the recovery of liver functions. This might salvage toxic acute liver failure and, more importantly, can delay or prevent the progression of some patients with advanced liver diseases into end-stage liver failure. Both treatments require a large number of hepatocytes. Human primary hepatocytes are ideal seed cells and mainly obtained from livers that are not suitable for liver transplantation. However, primary hepatocytes cannot be cultured and expanded in vitro and a source thereof is limited by the shortage of liver-derived donors. In recent years, the frontier cognition of researches on stem cells and the emergence of new technologies bring new opportunities for this breakthrough.", "true_sdg": "SDG3", "predicted_sdg": "SDG10", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 0.4931049346923828, "line_number": 201}

{"patent_number": "EP4325996A2", "description_number": 4, "description_text": "Note that when using the 5-GHz band, attention must be paid to DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection). The 5-GHz band overlaps a band to be used by a weather radar or the like. Thus, when performing P2P communication by causing a wireless base station or a device such as a printer to operate as an access point (Wi-Fi Direct<®> group owner or software AP), the access point needs to always monitor an interference wave of a channel in use so as to prevent wireless infrastructure communication from influencing the weather radar or the like. Note that the software AP indicates a function of playing the role of the access point in a software manner using a wireless chip incorporated in a device such as a printer or a personal computer. Wireless infrastructure communication indicates wireless communication in the infrastructure mode. Thus, when an interference wave is detected, the channel needs to be switched to another available channel immediately.  Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2010-278825  describes a technique in which when a wireless base station detects the radio waves of various radars such as the weather radar in wireless communication in the 5-GHz band, if communication needs to be stopped for a predetermined time, a channel is automatically changed to an available one. This technique is DFS. In addition to DFS, there is provided a radio wave interference avoidance function called TPC (Transmit Power Control), for which similar attention must be paid. In the 5-GHz band, there are W52, W53, W56, W58, and the like and usable bands are regulated by the law for each country or region. Among them, DFS is performed in the W53 and W56 bands. For example, in Japan, the W52 band (5.2-GHz band (5,150 to 5,250 MHz)), W53 band (5.3-GHz band (5,250 to 5,350 MHz)), and W56 band (5.6-GHz band (5,470 - 5,725 MHz)) are defined as usable bands in the 5-GHz band and only the W52 band is not influenced by an interference wave by DFS.

{"patent_number": "EP3915738A1", "description_number": 32, "description_text": "In an embodiment, the clamping and de-clamping action of the modular object holding unit 104 of the gripper apparatus 100 is depicted in  FIG. 14. FIG. 14  depicts a cross sectional view of the adaptor holding unit 102 of the gripper apparatus 100 of  FIG. 1 , in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. As depicted in  FIG. 14 , actuation of the gripper apparatus 100 starts when the motor 208 is energized. The energized motor coupled with the lead screw 118 makes it revolve. When the lead screw 118 is operated using the motor 208, the lead screw 118 is configured to move the plurality of threaded nut segments 218 A-C in at least one of (i) an upward direction and (ii) a downward direction in accordance with the direction of revolution of the lead screw 118. Further, based on the movement of the plurality of threaded nut segments 218 A-C, the first end 224 A and the second end 224 B of each of the link from the plurality of links 214 A-C rotate from an initial position to a desired position. In an embodiment, the first end 224 A and the second end 224 B of each of the link from the plurality of links 214 A-C rotate from an initial position to a desired position with reference to the linking component 204 and the hinging component 110. Further, based on the rotation of the first end 224 A and second end 224 B of each of the link from the plurality of links 214 A-C, each of the plurality of jaws 212 A-C move in a specific direction and lock the adaptor 108 into the tapered bottom surface 308 A of the lead screw housing 210. As can be seen in  FIG. 14 , one end of the threaded nut segment 218 is connected to the jaw 212 with the help of the link 214 using the hinging component 110 and the linking component 204, thereby the jaw 212 can only revolve around that certain point hence providing it with only 1 degree of freedom. For example, function of the jaw 212 is to clamp the adaptor holding unit 102 to the modular object holding unit 104. A tapered shaped step is machined around the adaptor 108. This tapered shape step helps the plurality of jaws 212 A-C to easily enter the plurality of tapered slots 306 A-C, thus clamping it to form positive locking between the adaptor holding unit 102 and the modular object holding unit 104. The movement of the plurality of threaded nut segments 218 A-C determine position of the plurality of jaws 212 A-C which in turn determine the clamping action and de-clamping action of the modular object holding unit 104. For instance, as shown in  FIG. 14 , when the threaded nut segment 218 is at uppermost position, then the corresponding link 214 is at its initial position (e.g., home position) and the jaw 212 revolves around corresponding hinging point in such a way that the jaw 212 moves inside the tapered shaped slot provided in the modular object holding unit 104 hence clamping the adaptor 108 with the modular object holding unit 104. Similarly, when the threaded nut segment 218 moves down, the corresponding link 214 experiences a relative inward motion and moves inside the plurality of tapered slots 306 A-C of the lead screw housing 210. The movement of the link 214 makes the jaw 212 revolve around the hinging point and leads to the de-clamping action of the adaptor 108 of modular object holding unit 104. In an embodiment, the plurality of jaws 212 A-C are configured to self-center and lock the adaptor 108 into the tapered bottom surface 308 B of the lead screw housing 210. In other words, design of the plurality of jaws 212 A-C is such that it should be adapted to locate into the slots provided in the adaptor 108 and fits into them. Tip of the plurality of jaws 212 A-C at bottom are made tapered and curve in shape so that they can easily fit into the slots (e.g., threaded slots wherein the jaws fitting into these threaded slots is depicted in  FIG. 12  as an example embodiment) provided in the adaptor 108. In an embodiment, the adaptor 108 is connected in between the modular object holding unit 104 and the adaptor holding unit 102. The adaptor 108 comprises a plurality of female connectors 916 A-C (alternatively referred as female type floating connectors) embodied in it. However, the lead screw housing 210 comprises a plurality of male connectors 922 A-C (alternatively referred as male type floating connectors) which get connected when clamping and de-clamping of the gripper apparatus 100 happens. For easy clamping and de-clamping, the plurality of locating tapers 310 A-C are provided both in the adaptor 108 and the lead screw housing 210.", "true_sdg": "None", "predicted_sdg": "SDG10", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 1.7447125911712646, "line_number": 204}

{"patent_number": "EP4333542A2", "description_number": 92, "description_text": "That is, if Msg3 grant 1 has start time to as specified as in legacy Rel-13, grant 2 would have start time t0 + Δt, and grant 3 would have start time t0 + 2*Δt. The value of Δt is signaled from the network, e.g., by using the table illustrated in  Figure 14 . ;[0093]    In alternate embodiments of this solution, n bits out of the possible 15 bits used in the legacy grant in RAR may indicate the MCS index. With n bits, n^2 different combinations of (modulation,) RUs and TBS could be signaled (with Table 1 showing example of n=5, as discussed above). In particular, the reserved bits of such a legacy grant may be used to signal offsets for f- and t-positions. ;[0094]    The base station 110 may select the MCS index (table entry) to be provided to the wireless device 120 in RAR depending on one or more of the following:\nChannel conditions, e.g. radio network load or estimate from Msg1 reception.\nNumber of Msg3-grants that can be handled by base station 110 (i.e. table entries could be repeated with different number of Msg3-grants.)\nCommonly used EDT size used in the operators network, i.e. allow for 'repeated' table entries with focus on higher or lower TBSs.\nOther factors;[0095]    In another embodiment, the number of (TBS, RUs) pairs can vary among a predefined set of values, for example {2,3,5}. This number of pairs can be adaptively decided by the base station 110 and signaled to UEs, e.g., via cell-specific signaling based on, for example, the commonly used EDT TBS in the network and/or desired additional complexity from blind decoding of received Msg3. For the considered example, there can have 3 pre-defined tables, similar in form to that depicted by Table 3, and corresponding to three cases of 2, 3 or 5 choices of TBS the wireless device 120 may select from. This may allow for the adaptive adjustment (reconfiguration) of granularity level in providing multiple UL grants for Msg3 taking into account the decoding overhead and wireless device 120 behavior when in selecting EDT grant, that in turn helps improve the efficiency of EDT. ;[0096]    Another way to signal the Msg3 multi-grant information is to signal part of the information (e.g., information in Table 3) in the system information (SI), and more information (e.g., the MCS index) in a RAR message (i.e., Msg2) to the wireless device 120. Whether a cell supports EDT may also be indicated in the SI, though this indication need not be explicit. Thus, according to particular embodiments, this SI may include a one or more bits to indicate the supported TBSs. The SI may further indicate the modulation and number of RUs. The supported values may be chosen from a set of predefined values, e.g., in a table, but only the values indicated in the SI are supported in the cell. Then in the RAR message to a specific wireless device 120, the base station 110 may indicate which UL grants (pre-defined in SI) the wireless device 120 may select from for the transmission of Msg3. Each of the UL resources may have a corresponding entry in the information indicated in the SI. The number of subcarriers and number of repetitions may be the same or different for each of the UL resources, according to the particular embodiment. ;[0097]    Figure 15  illustrates a non-limiting example of such signalling as may be found, e.g., in an NB-loT system. The base station 110 signals the values in the table illustrated in  Figure 15  that can be used for user data transmission in Msg3. ;[0098]    In the RAR message to the wireless device 120, the base station 110 may further indicate which of the TBS(s) may be used by the wireless device 120 for Msg3 PUSCH, e.g., as illustrated in the non-limiting example of  Figure 16 . ;[0099]    Accordingly, embodiments may provide the wireless device 120 with less choice than what the cell supports, e.g., based on:\nChannel conditions.\nNumber of Msg3-grants that can be handled by base station 110 (i.e. table entries could be repeated with different number of Msg3-grants.)\nCommonly used EDT size used in the operators network, i.e. allow for 'repeated' table entries with focus on higher or lower TBSs.\nOther factors;[0100]    This solution may use fewer bits in the RAR as compared to indicating an MCS index that indicates TBS, modulation, and number of RUs for Msg3. Therefore, it is possible to signal different number of subcarriers, and/or number of repetitions for each of the UL resources. In this solution it is possible to use similar format as the legacy grant format (as discussed above) without increase the size of RAR. ;[0101]    If the same frequency and time position for the multi-grants are not assumed (as in certain embodiments discussed above), the table in  Figure 15  may, in an alternative embodiment, be extended to cover the relative time or frequency position of the grants, or a separate entry in the table of  Figure 16  may indicate a lack of dependency between, e.g., the TBS and the time offset. Another advantage of embodiments that use this particular type of signalling (e.g., as compared to one or more embodiments discussed above) is that the TBS or grant information given in the table of  Figure 15  may be set to any values. For example, such values may be updated over time or set differently in different cells or by different operators. ;[0102]    Yet other embodiments of the present disclosure only signal the largest (TBS, RUs) and the number of UL resources to the wireless device 120. The wireless device 120 then derives the smaller (TBS, RUs) pairs implicitly. The relationship between the largest (TBS, RUs) and the smaller one(s) may be predefined in the spec, e.g., by means of a function. For example, the base station 110 may indicate that the largest usable (TBS, RUs) is (1000, 7) as shown in the table of  Figure 17  (or other table, e.g., Table 16.5.1.2-2 of 3GPP TS 36.213), and further indicate that the wireless device 120 has two additional choices with smaller TBSs together with an offset between the two consecutive grants (e.g., an offset of 3 in this example). Then the wireless device 120 may then derive the two smaller grants as (504, 4), and (176, 2). ;[0103]    More generally, a table (e.g., such as that in  Figure 17 ) may be used to indicate one of the (TBS, RUs) entries (e.g., the largest or the smallest, according to particular embodiments). If this entry is unique, the wireless device 120 may locate the other (TBS, RUs) as being in the same row as the indicated (TBS, RUs) entry. ;[0104]    In one example embodiment the largest grant may be given with legacy signaling, and the offset for the smaller (TBS, RUs) pair(s) may be specified in System Information. ;[0105]    Alternatively, in some embodiments, a linear function is used to derive the smaller (TBS, RUs) based on the largest (TBS_largest, RUs_largest). For example, if two smaller (TBS, RUs) pairs are supported in addition to the largest (TBS_largest, RUs_largest), the two smaller (TBS, RUs) pairs may be derived according to, e.g., the formulas:\nround(TBS_largest / 2), round(RUs_largest / 2); and\nround(TBS_largest / 3), round(RUs_largest / 3).;[0106]    According to another example in which two smaller (TBS, RUs) pairs are supported in addition to the largest (TBS_largest, RUs_largest), the two smaller (TBS, RUs) pairs may be derived according to, e.g., the formulas:\nround(TBS_largest / N), round(RUs_largest / N); and,\nround(TBS_largest / (N-1)), round(RUs_largest / (N-1))where N is the number of signaled uplink resource allocation candidates. In this particular example, N=3. ;[0107]    Other embodiments may include other formulae or mechanisms for determining one or more (TBS, RUs) pairs. Particular embodiments may additionally or alternatively use the minimum viable packet as a parameter or factor in deriving the possible TBS. For example, the entry in the row of the table of  Figure 17  may begin with the minimum viable packet, but may correspond to different granularities in the row or otherwise. ;[0108]    One particular example may use, e.g., a linear function to derive the larger (TBS, RUs) based on the minimum viable packet (TBS_minimum, RUs_ minimum) by using similar methods stated above. ;[0109]    Certain embodiments discussed above assume that the size of the RAR remains the same as in legacy implementations, e.g., to allow for multiplexing of legacy and EDT UEs in the same MAC RA response message. In some embodiments, a legacy wireless device 120 may have to be able to \"read past\" other RARs when looking for its own RAR given by Random Access Preamble Identifier (RAPID). Alternatively, separate RA response messages for legacy UEs and EDT UEs are used within the RAR window. That is, an EDT wireless device 120 which has transmitted Msg1 on a EDT NPRACH resource may ignore the legacy RA response message and look for the new EDT RA response message. A new MAC header or different RAPIDs may be introduced for this purpose. In this case, many of the embodiments discussed above may be implemented without being restricted by size constraint. Indeed, the new EDT RAR may have any size, depending on the particular embodiment. In one embodiment, the separate RAR message may be in the padding region of the MAC PDU. ;[0110]    The following embodiments may be particularly useful for BL/CE UEs (eMTC, LTE-M):\nTypical eMTC systems have a maximum size for Msg3 of 712 bits for BL/CE UEs in CE mode A, and 328 bits for BL/CE UEs in CE mode B. The table in  Figure 18  shows an example of definitions of the UL grant field in the MAC RAR for BL/CE UEs. The MCS/TBS fields correspond to a maximum UL TBS of 712 bits for CE mode A and 328 bits for CE mode B. ;[0111]    As previously discussed, this maximum may not be large enough to exploit the benefit of EDT. One option to address this may be to increase the maximum bits for Msg3, e.g., to 1000 bits for PRACH CE level 0 & 1 (\"CE mode A\") and 936 bits for PRACH CE levels 2 & 3 (\"CE mode B\"). Since the wireless device 120 is in idle mode, the wireless device 120 may not be able to report its uplink buffer size to the base station 110, and hence the base station 110 may have difficulties in determining the exact UL resource (TBS size) that needs to be allocated to a wireless device 120. As discussed above, if more resource is allocated to the wireless device 120, then the wireless device 120 may need to pad the unused resource, which may use excessive radio resources and power if the allocated resource is significantly larger than what the wireless device 120 needs. ;[0112]    Embodiments of the present disclosure provide multiple UL resource choices (e.g., in terms of TBS/MCS, number of repetitions for Msg3 PUSCH) for the wireless device 120 to autonomously select the best option. The wireless device 120 may choose the most appropriate UL resource to send its UL data in Msg3. Certain embodiments may require many additional bits of information in Msg2 to indicate these choices. However, increasing the size of Msg2 may cause backward compatibility issues (i.e., because the MAC RA response message contains multiple RARs, including both EDT and legacy UEs, the RAR size cannot change). Also, since the wireless device 120 would only choose one of the UL resources, it may be a waste of resource if excessive UL resources are reserved but not used (or only a small portion is used) by the wireless device 120. ;[0113]    Embodiments of the present disclosure reduce or minimize the message size in the UL grant carried by Msg2 and/or provide several UL allocation candidates for the wireless device 120 to choose from. Embodiments may additionally or alternatively aid in reducing or minimizing the UL resource usage in the system. ;[0114]    Allocation of the UL resources as candidates for the UL Msg3 transmission may be performed in various ways, according to particular embodiments (e.g., as described above with respect to  Figures 12A-E ). As described above, in one such embodiment, the starting points of the resources are aligned as illustrated in  Figure 12A . That is, the Msg3 PUSCH Resource allocation indicates the same frequency resources for all the UL resources, but each of them has a different length in time, defined, e.g., by different number of repetitions. ;[0115]    Other embodiments include one or more fixed or configurable timing offsets between each of the UL resources. The timing offset(s) may include a time offset (e.g., as shown in  Figure 12B ), a frequency offset (e.g., as shown in  Figure 12C ), or both a time and frequency offset (e.g., as shown in  Figure 12D ) which are added between different allocated UL resources, similar to embodiments discussed above. Other embodiments include a same starting time of the msg3 PUSCH for all the UL resources, but each may have a different number of PRBs in frequency and/or length in time, as shown in  Figure 12E . ;[0116]    In another embodiment it is proposed to have separate MAC RA response messages for legacy UEs and EDT UEs, allowing for a larger RAR size and still maintaining backwards compatibility. ;[0117]    In addition to allocating the resources, the multiple UL resource allocation may need to be signalled to the wireless device 120 in particular embodiments. The following paragraphs discuss examples of such embodiments in which the multiple UL resource allocation grants are signalled to the wireless device 120. ;[0118]    In particular, each of the candidate UL resources may be defined by a TBS/MCS, the allocated frequency resources (in terms of PRBs), and a number of repetitions. In eMTC, a TBS may be mapped to one or more PRBs in the frequency domain first, and repetitions may used for enhanced coverage if needed or desired. ;[0119]    When a smaller TBS is mapped to the same number of PRBs in the frequency domain, the code rate is lower. Therefore, less number of repetitions are generally needed in order to achieve the same coverage. ;[0120]    Accordingly, embodiments of the present disclosure include a table for the UL grant pre-configuration with different indexes corresponding to different candidate TBSs and corresponding number of repetitions, assuming the same number of PRBs are used in the frequency domain. In such embodiments, (TBS, number of repetitions) pairs are defined and signalled to a wireless device 120 as a bunded configuration, e.g. using an index to the table which points to several of the (TBS, number of repetitions) pairs. The wireless device 120 can choose one of them for its UL Msg3 transmission. These (BS, number of repetitions) pairs should result in similar coverage. Although the table in  Figure 19  illustrates an example of such a table, other embodiments may include other formats, values, and/or fields, for example. ;[0121]    In the example of  Figure 19 , five bits are used to signal one of up to 32 different indices. In this example, each MCS index entry corresponds to at most 3 different (TBS, Number of repetitions for TBS) pairs. ;[0122]    In the example given in the table of  Figure 19 , the number of repetitions may be explicitly signaled for each of the TBSs. Other embodiments may signal/derive the number of repetitions implicitly, e.g, based on the configured maximum number of repetitions for PUSCH. The table in  Figure 20  illustrates another non-exclusive example in which the maximum number of configured repetitions in the cell is Y. There may be two values of Y signaled also, e.g., one for CE mode A and another for CE mode B. If the final results in the entry of the number of repetitions is not an integer, the number of repetitions may be rounded up or down to provide an appropriate integer number. ;[0123]    In these examples, five bits are used to signal the MCS index. In one such embodiment, two additional bits are used as compared to a legacy grant (which is typically 3 bits). In some embodiments, these two additional bits are taken from the 'Msg3 PUSCH Resource allocation' field, leaving only the larger resource allocations which are most relevant for the larger TBS sizes. The order of the bit fields of the grant may be different from legacy, or may interpreted differently from the legacy fields, e.g., by combining different bit locations. As an example, the subcarrier indication field may be the most significant bit (MSB) of the MCS index, one bit of the subcarrier indication field may be the second most significant of the MCS index, and the 3 bits of the legacy MCS index would be used as the least significant (LSB) bits. ;[0124]    Alternatively (e.g., if these additional bits are not available), the tables in  Figures 19  and  20  may contain fewer entries and use a 3 bit index for CE mode A, or 2 bits for CE mode B. In some embodiments, the TBS values for EDT for CE mode A and B are in accordance with the table illustrated in  Figure 33 . ;[0125]    Embodiments described above may use the same frequency-position and same time start position, e.g., as shown in  Figure 12A . Alternatively (i.e., if the multiple grants do not each have the same f- and t-position), additional bits may be required to specify, e.g., the f- and t-position of additional grants (e.g., grants 2 and 3). That is (for example), if 3 bits would be sufficient for configuring the multi grant in the table of  Figure 19 , two bits may be used as an index to point out 4 different pre-configurations with frequency and time offsets for the other multi grants relative to a first multi grant. For example, if the number of multigrants is 3 as in the table of  Figure 11 , but only 3 bits used for the selection, 2 bits could be used to specify the time offset relative to grant 1 according to the table in  Figure 14 . ;[0126]    That is, if Msg3 grant 1 has start time t0 (e.g., as specified as in legacy Rel-13), grant 2 would have start time t0 + Δt, and grant 3 would have start time t0 + 2*Δt.", "true_sdg": "None", "predicted_sdg": "SDG10", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 1.7873773574829102, "line_number": 222}

For etching gases, perfluorocyclobutane (1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4-octafluorocyclobutane (C4F8)) as a sulfur-free Comparative Example and perfluorothiacyclopentane (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5-octafluorotetrahydrothiophene (C4F8S)) represented by the formula below as a sulfur-containing Example of the present invention were used.\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"716994257-ib0011\" />\n[Table 1]\nTable 1 Etching Test Conditions \n<tb>SAMCO RIE-10NR\n<tb>Ar /etching gas/O2<SEP>50/20 (x)/*(y) [seem]\n<tb>Pressure<SEP>10.0 [Pa]\n<tb>RF power<SEP>300 [W];[0026]    The test results are shown in  Fig. 1 . In  Fig. 1 , BD-3 represents Black Diamond 3. Ar and an etching gas were allowed to flow constantly at rates of 50 sccm and 20 sccm, respectively, while varying the rate (sccm) of oxygen (O2). The etching of ACL started at around over 20% of the rate of oxygen relative to the total (x + y) of an etching gas (x) and oxygen (y). ;[0027]    In the case of the etching gas (C4F8S) of the Example, the etching rate of SiO2 sharply increased with the increase in O2 ratio to reach the maximum (approximately 80 nm/min) at the O2 ratio of near 25%. Concerning the etching rate of SiO2, the Comparative Example (C4F8) also exhibited the similar behavior. Moreover, both the etching gas (C4F8S) of the Example and the etching gas (C4F8) of the Comparative Example exhibited, although differences in etching rate values are observed, the similar behavior in which the etching rates of SiN, BD-3, SiON, SiCN, and SiOCN increase gradually with the increase in O2 ratio and start to increase sharply at around the O2 ratio of over 20%. ;[0028]    For the results in the Example and Comparative Example, the etching rate ratios of SiO2/BD-3, SiO2/SiON, SiO2/SiCN, and SiO2/SiOCN are obtained and summarized in  Fig. 2 . As shown in  Fig. 2 , the behavior in which the etching rate ratios are high at the O2 ratio of 20% but are low at the O2 ratio of 33% was confirmed for both the Example and the Comparative Example. ;[0029]    For the results in the Example and the Comparative Example, the etching rate ratios of ACL/SiO2, ACL/SiN, ACL/polysilicon (Poly-Si), ACL/BD-3, ACL/SiON, ACL/SiCN, and ACL/SiOCN at the O2 ratio of 33% are obtained and summarized in  Fig. 3. Fig. 3  reveals that the etching gas of the Example exhibits, for all the materials, higher etching rate ratios relative to ACL than the etching gas of the Comparative Example. ;[0030]    The foregoing results revealed that remarkable differences in etching behavior exist between the Example of the present invention, in which a sulfur-containing etching gas is used, and the Comparative Example, in which a conventional sulfur-free etching gas is used. In other words, it can be concluded that the novel etching gas of the present invention has high selectivity between SiO2 and low-k materials (SiON, SiCN, SiOCN, SiOC) similar to a conventional etching gas. Meanwhile, by adopting a novel sulfur-containing compound, the etching rate of ACL does not increase in the present invention despite the increase in O2 ratio. Consequently, the etching selectivity between ACL and low-k materials is higher than a conventional etching gas. Moreover, by using the etching gas of the present invention in combination with a conventional etching gas, it is possible to change a difference in etching rate between ACL and low-k materials, thereby making further accurate etching possible. *", "true_sdg": "None", "predicted_sdg": "SDG10", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 1.698573350906372, "line_number": 232}

Plasma Processes and Polymers 2015, 12 (10), 1174-1185 .] Chinese patent  CN107058982  provides a method for preparation of liquid-resistant coating with multi-layer structure, in which inert gas or nitrogen is introduced in the treatment stage of chemical vapor deposition process and in the process of coating deposition. Inert gas is helium or argon. US patent US6663713  discloses a method and apparatus for forming a polymer layer on a semiconductor substrate in combination with deposition (and etching) of any polymer or polymerizable dielectric substrate, including, for instance, xylene, tetrafluoroethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, naphthalene or polynaphthalene. A continuous supply of reactionpolymerizable material can be supplied to the chamber through a gas inlet. Preferably, inert carrier gas such as helium or argon is used to supply the reaction polymerizable material to the chamber. The inert gas and radio frequency bias can be used to form plasma in the processing chamber. However, inventors found that as inert gas was used as plasma source, the hydrophobicity of the nanocoating obtained by plasma chemical vapor deposition was generally poor, and even the contact angle was lower than 100°, when the number of carbon atoms of the perfluorocarbon chain used as reaction material was lower than 6, especially lower than 4.", "true_sdg": "None", "predicted_sdg": "SDG10", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 0.8265159130096436, "line_number": 256}

Another Pl-Scel site was engineered at the 5' end of a ∼7,852 bp genomic fragment containing the mouse heavy chain intronic enhancer, the IgM switch region (Sµ) and the IgM gene of the mouse heavy chain locus. This mouse fragment was used as a 3' homology arm by ligation to the ∼110.5 kb human fragment, which created a 3' junction containing, from 5' to 3', ∼110.5 kb of genomic sequence of the human κ light chain locus containing the first six consecutive VK gene segments and five Jκ gene segments, a Pl-Scel site, ∼7,852 bp of mouse heavy chain sequence containing the mouse intronic enhancer, Sµ and the mouse IgM constant gene. Upstream (5') from the human VK1-6 gene segment was an additional 3,710 bp of human κ sequence before the start of the 5' mouse homology arm, which contained 19,752 bp of mouse genomic DNA corresponding to sequence 5' of the mouse heavy chain locus. Between the 5' homology arm and the beginning of the human κ sequence was a neomycin cassette flanked by three recombinase recognition sites (see Targeting Vector 1,  FIG. 2 ). The final targeting vector for the first insertion of human κ sequence from 5' to 3' included a 5' homology arm containing -20 kb of mouse genomic sequence 5' of the heavy chain locus, a first recombinase recognition site (R1), a neomycin cassette, a second recombinase recognition site (R2), a third recombinase recognition site (R3), ∼110.5 kb of human genomic κ sequence containing the first six consecutive human Vκ gene segments and five human Jκ gene segments, a Pl-Scel site, and a 3' homology arm containing ∼8 kb of mouse genomic sequence including the intronic enhancer, Sµ and the mouse IgM constant gene (see  FIG. 2 , Targeting Vector 1). Homologous recombination with this targeting vector created a modified mouse heavy chain locus containing six human Vκ gene segments and five human Jκ gene segments operably linked to the endogenous mouse heavy chain constant genes which, upon recombination, leads to the formation of a hybrid heavy chain (i.e., a human VK domain and a mouse CH region).\nTable 1 \n<tb>Targeting Vector<SEP>Size of Human κ Sequence<SEP>Human κ Gene Segments Added\n<tb>Vκ<SEP>Jκ\n<tb>1<SEP>∼110.5 kb<SEP>4-1, 5-2, 7-3, 2-4, 1-5, 1-6<SEP>1 - 5\n<tb>2<SEP>∼140 kb<SEP>3-7, 1-8, 1-9, 2-10, 3-11, 1-12, 1-13, 2-14, 3-15, 1-16<SEP>-\n<tb>3<SEP>∼161 kb<SEP>1-17, 2-18, 2-19, 3-20, 6-21, 1-22, 1-23, 2-24, 3-25, 2-26, 1-27, 2-28, 2-29, 2-30<SEP>-\n<tb>4<SEP>∼90 kb<SEP>3-31, 1-32, 1-33, 3-34, 1-35, 2-36, 1-37, 2-38, 1-39, 2-40<SEP>-", "true_sdg": "None", "predicted_sdg": "SDG10", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 1.474121332168579, "line_number": 260}

{"patent_number": "EP4191278A1", "description_number": 594, "description_text": "Fig. 46A  depicts diagram 4600 illustrating an example of LIDAR detection scheme for cross traffic turns. Autonomous vehicle 4510 of  Fig. 45  may enter an intersection for a cross-lane turn. In other embodiments, the autonomous vehicle may enter a T junction, a Y intersection, or any other type of intersection/junction for a cross-lane turn. Autonomous vehicle 4510 may follow a path, e.g., trajectory 4620, for the cross-lane turn. As autonomous vehicle 4510 enters the intersection (or even before), processor 118 may increase light flux levels to a portion of the LIDAR field of view represented by FOV portions 4525, 4522, and 4523. A a result a potential detection range associated with those portions may increase relative to other portions of the total LIDAR FOV. For example, as depicted, FOV portion 4522 may have a detection range greater than FOV portion 4521; FOV portion 4523 may have a detection range greater than 4524; FOV portion 4525 (the portion on a side of the vehicle facing the oncoming direction of the lane being crossed) may have a detection range greater than FOV portion 4526 and may also have a detection range greater than FOV portions 4522 and 4523. In some cases, the detection range of FOV portion 4525 may be more than twice as long as is other FOV portions. As depicted in  Fig. 46A , FOV portion 4525, on the right side of the vehicle, may be allocated the highest light flux and have the largest detection range during the left cross-lane turn because it is in a direction determined to be overlapping with a region of interest. Detection ranges of FOV portions 4521, 4526, and 4524, on the left side of the vehicle may remain unchanged relative to their default values (e.g., as shown in  Fig. 45  prior to the cross-lane turn shown in  Fig. 46A ). Alternatively, light flux projected to any of FOV portions 4521, 4526, and 4524, on the left side of the vehicle may be reduced relative to their default values during the cross-lane turn. FOV portion 4527, capturing the front of autonomous vehicle 4510 during the cross-turn situation of  Fig. 46A  may be allocated with a light flux level lower than a level normally allocated to the forward FOV portion in a non-cross-lane situation. For example, as shown in  Fig. 45 , FOV portion 4527 may be allocated a higher light flux value, which in turn may increase the detection range for FOV portion 4527, in situations such as a vehicle travelling at speed on a road. A light flux level of FOV portion 4527 may be reduced in a cross-lane situation as speeds may be lower than the situation shown in  Fig. 45 . Also, the side of the vehicle adjacent to oncoming traffic in a cross-lane situation may represent a region of higher interest (e.g., from a potential collision standpoint) as compared to a forward travelling direction of the vehicle in the cross-lane situation of  Fig. 46A . Of course, as right turns (e.g., in the US and other countries where cars travel on the right side of the road) may not involve cross-lane situations, it may not be necessary to increase the light flux in FOV portions of the LIDAR system residing on a left side of the vehicle. In countries such as Japan and the UK, however, light flux supplied to FOV portions on the left side of the vehicle may be increased during a right turn cross-lane situation. Processor 118 may be equipped to automatically determine a location for the host vehicle (e.g., based on the output of a vehicle navigation system, a GPS sensor, etc.) and control the light flux applied to the various FOV portions according to driving customs/road configurations, etc. in the determined location.", "true_sdg": "None", "predicted_sdg": "SDG10", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 1.454446792602539, "line_number": 266}
{"patent_number": "EP3785644A1", "description_number": 47, "description_text": "Turning now to  FIGs. 64-65 , there is shown a cross-sectional view of the end effector 18 taken perpendicular to the longitudinal axis with the I-beam 32 located in the cross-section. In the present invention, a stapler is provided that has an end effector 18 with a smaller diameter, such as in the range of 5-10 mm, without significantly changing the ability of the smaller stapler of the present invention to staple tissue having the same thickness as a relatively larger stapler, that is keeping the gap width between the upper jaw 48 and the lower jaw 50 substantially the same. This is accomplished by employing circumferential staple channels 53 in the lower jaw 50 with staples 54, 100 and pushers 58 configured to function within the circumferential channels 53. The circumferential channels 53 take advantage of the longer distance transcribed by a circumferential distance within the outer perimeter of the substantially circular cross-section of the end effector 18 relative to a shorter distance transcribed by a line represented by line 7b having a length SB shown in  FIG. 1B  that is perpendicular to a chord representing the upper surface of the lower jaw 48. In order to maximize the length of the circumferential line segment that is located within the outer perimeter of the circular cross-section and representative of a circumferential staple channel 53, the staple channel 53 is advantageously located as close to the outer perimeter as possible. Such placement of the outermost staple channel 53 permits the inner staple line that lies closest to the I-beam 32 to be located further away from the diametrical blade line and also allows for a longer radially-outermost staple channel 53 for receiving a staple with longer legs for the secure stapling of thicker tissues. In traditional linear staples, the lower jaw 50 comprises an outer lower jaw 51 that forms a semi-cylindrical shell of substantial thickness. Inside this shell of the outer lower jaw 51, the staples and pushers are resident. One of the functions of the outer lower jaw 51 other than forming a container for the staples is to provide structural rigidity and strength to the lower jaw so that when the staples are deployed the actuation force does not crack open, deform or bend the lower jaw itself. Therefore, the outer lower jaw 51 is typically made of strong plastic or metal of a certain thickness. This thickness of the outer lower jaw 51 is reduced in the present invention as shown in  FIGs. 64-65  so that the outermost staple channel 53 can be located as close to the perimeter as possible to maximize the staple leg length that can be located therein as well as maximize the distance of the innermost staple channel away from the blade line. However, the thinner outer lower jaw 51 sacrifices lower jaw 50 strength and rigidity. This weakening is solved in the present invention by forming a frame 112 that is located inside the outer lower jaw 51 in an endoskeleton-like configuration as opposed to the exoskeleton-like configuration of traditional staplers in which the outer lower jaw 51 is made as thick as possible to provide structural rigidity to the end effector. The endoskeleton-like frame 112 of the present invention may be part of or separate from the inner lower jaw 52. The frame 112 has a thickness of approximately 0.025 inches and extends along the length of the lower jaw 50. The frame 112 is made of strong plastic or metal and forms the upper surface 114 of the lower jaw 50 from which the staple channels 53 open and from which staples exit. The frame 112 forms a substantial T-shape configuration that is divided down the midline of the \"T\" by the central lower jaw channel 55 in which the I-beam 32 translates. The bottom portion 36 of the I-beam 32 is substantially equal in width to the width of the vertical portion of the \"T\" which comprises the width of two frames 112 and the width of the central lower jaw channel 55 as can be seen in  FIGs. 64-65 . The bottom portion 36 of the I-beam 32 is interconnected to the top portion 34 of the I-beam 32 by a middle portion 38 of the I-beam 32. The middle portion of the I-beam 32 is substantially the same thickness as the thickness of one frame 112. The T-shaped frame 112 is formed by the juxtaposition of two L-shape elements spaced apart from each other by the central lower jaw channel 55. The horizontal portions of the L-shaped elements 116A, 116B or portions that are transverse to the I-beam 32 extend all the way to the perimeter 118. In the variation shown in  FIGs. 64-65 , the frame 112 has angled horizontal or transverse elements 120 which form a substantially Y-shaped frame 112. Hence, the L-shaped elements 116 form obtuse angles instead of substantially right angles common to the T-shape. The angled transverse elements 120 extend all the way to the perimeter 118 as shown in  FIGs. 64-65 . The transverse elements 120 include a point of inflection at which the transverse elements transition from being perpendicular to the middle portion 38 of the I-beam 32 to being angled with respect to the middle portion 38. This angulation of the frame 112 opens up more space inside the lower jaw 50, in particular, adjacent to the perimeter where longer staples legs can be accommodated. In this variation, the upper jaw 48 includes a reinforcement 122 divided by the central slot 76 in the upper jaw 48. The reinforcement 122 of the upper jaw 48 includes the anvil surface 74. The anvil surface 74 is generally angled in a manner that parallels or corresponds substantially with the angle of upper surface 114 of the lower jaw 50. The gap for capturing tissue is defined between the anvil surface 74 and the upper surface 114 of the lower jaw 50. The reinforcement 122 is made of metal or plastic.", "true_sdg": "None", "predicted_sdg": "SDG10", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 1.7315690517425537, "line_number": 267}

{"patent_number": "EP4066856A1", "description_number": 184, "description_text": "In general, eight different methods have been used for preparing liposomes according to the invention. These are referred to in the text as methods (A) to (H) and they differ mainly in relation to filtration and TFF steps. Details are as follows:\n(A) Fresh lipid stock solutions in ethanol were prepared. 37 mg of DlinDMA, 11.8 mg of DSPC, 27.8 mg of Cholesterol and 8.07 mg of PEG DMG 2000 were weighed and dissolved in 7.55 mL of ethanol. The freshly prepared lipid stock solution was gently rocked at 37°C for about 15 min to form a homogenous mixture. Then, 755 µL of the stock was added to 1.245 mL ethanol to make a working lipid stock solution of 2 mL. This amount of lipids was used to form liposomes with 250 µg RNA. A 2 mL working solution of RNA was also prepared from a stock solution of ∼ 1 µg/µL in 100 mM citrate buffer (pH 6). Three 20 mL glass vials (with stir bars) were rinsed with RNase Away solution (Molecular BioProducts, San Diego, CA) and washed with plenty of MilliQ water before use to decontaminate the vials of RNases. One of the vials was used for the RNA working solution and the others for collecting the lipid and RNA mixes (as described later). The working lipid and RNA solutions were heated at 37°C for 10 min before being loaded into 3cc luer-lok syringes. 2 mL of citrate buffer (pH 6) was loaded in another 3 cc syringe. Syringes containing RNA and the lipids were connected to a T mixer (PEEK<™> 500 µm ID junction, Idex Health Science, Oak Harbor, WA) using FEP tubing (fluorinated ethylene-propylene; al FEP tubing has a 2mm internal diameter x 3mm outer diameter, supplied by Idex Health Science). The outlet from the T mixer was also FEP tubing. The third syringe containing the citrate buffer was connected to a separate piece of FEP tubing. All syringes were then driven at a flow rate of 7 mL/min using a syringe pump. The tube outlets were positioned to collect the mixtures in a 20 mL glass vial (while stirring). The stir bar was taken out and the ethanol/aqueous solution was allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 1 hour. 4 ml of the mixture was loaded into a 5 cc syringe, which was connected to a piece of FEP tubing and in another 5 cc syringe connected to an equal length of FEP tubing, an equal amount of 100 mM citrate buffer (pH 6) was loaded. The two syringes were driven at 7mL/min flow rate using the syringe pump and the final mixture collected in a 20 mL glass vial (while stirring). Next, the mixture collected from the second mixing step (liposomes) were passed through a Mustang Q membrane (an anion-exchange support that binds and removes anionic molecules, obtained from Pall Corporation, AnnArbor, MI, USA). Before passing the liposomes, 4 mL of 1 M NaOH, 4 mL of 1 M NaCl and 10 mL of 100 mM citrate buffer (pH 6) were successively passed through the Mustang membrane. Liposomes were warmed for 10 min at 37°C before passing through the membrane. Next, liposomes were concentrated to 2 mL and dialyzed against 10-15 volumes of IX PBS using TFF before recovering the final product. The TFF system and hollow fiber filtration membranes were purchased from Spectrum Labs and were used according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Polysulfone hollow fiber filtration membranes (part number P/N: X1AB-100-20P) with a 100 kD pore size cutoff and 8 cm<2> surface area were used. For in vitro and in vivo experiments, formulations were diluted to the required RNA concentration with IX PBS.\n(B) As method (A) except that, after rocking, 226.7 µL of the stock was added to 1.773 mL ethanol to make a working lipid stock solution of 2 mL, thus modifying the lipid:RNA ratio.\n(C) As method (B) except that the Mustang filtration was omitted, so liposomes went from the 20 mL glass vial into the TFF dialysis.\n(D) As method (C) except that the TFF used polyethersulfone (PES) hollow fiber membranes (part number P-C1-100E-100-01N) with a 100 kD pore size cutoff and 20 cm<2> surface area.\n(E) As method (D) except that a Mustang membrane was used, as in method (A).\n(F) As method (A) except that the Mustang filtration was omitted, so liposomes went from the 20 mL glass vial into the TFF dialysis.\n(G) As method (D) except that a 4 mL working solution of RNA was prepared from a stock solution of ~ 1µg/µL in 100 mM citrate buffer (pH 6). Then four 20 mL glass vials were prepared in the same way. Two of them were used for the RNA working solution (2 mL in each vial) and the others for collecting the lipid and RNA mixes, as in (C). Rather than use T mixer, syringes containing RNA and the lipids were connected to a Mitos Droplet junction Chip (a glass microfluidic device obtained from Syrris, Part no. 3000158) using PTFE tubing (0.03 inches internal diameter x 1/16 inch outer diameter) using a 4-way edge connector (Syrris). Two RNA streams and one lipid stream were driven by syringe pumps and the mixing of the ethanol and aqueous phase was done at the X junction (100 µm x 105 µm) of the chip. The flow rate of all three streams was kept at 1.5 mL/min, hence the ratio of total aqueous to ethanolic flow rate was 2:1. The tube outlet was positioned to collect the mixtures in a 20 mL glass vial (while stirring). The stir bar was taken out and the ethanol/aqueous solution was allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 1 h. Then the mixture was loaded in a 5 cc syringe, which was fitted to another piece of the PTFE tubing; in another 5 cc syringe with equal length of PTFE tubing, an equal volume of 100 mM citrate buffer (pH 6) was loaded. The two syringes were driven at 3mL/min flow rate using a syringe pump and the final mixture collected in a 20 mL glass vial (while stirring). Next, liposomes were concentrated to 2 mL and dialyzed against 10-15 volumes of IX PBS using TFF, as in (D).\n(H) As method (A) except that the 2mL working lipid stock solution was made by mixing 120.9 µL of the lipid stock with 1.879 mL ethanol. Also, after mixing in the T mixer the liposomes from the 20mL vial were loaded into Pierce Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis Cassette (Thermo Scientific, extra strength, 0.5-3 mL capacity) and dialyzed against 400-500 mL of IX PBS overnight at 4°C in an autoclaved plastic container before recovering the final product.", "true_sdg": "None", "predicted_sdg": "SDG10", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 1.7849516868591309, "line_number": 292}

{"patent_number": "EP4279132A2", "description_number": 6, "description_text": "The management of patients with migraine is often unsatisfactory because available acute and preventive therapies are either ineffective or poorly tolerated. The acute treatment of migraine attacks has been limited to the use of analgesics, combinations of analgesics with caffeine, ergotamines, and the triptans. Despite the availability of certain preventive medications for migraine, many patients do not respond to these treatments or are unable to tolerate them. (For a description of such agents see e.g.  New Therapeutic Approaches for the Prevention and Treatment of Migraine, Diener, H.C. et al., (2015) Lancet Neurology, 14:1010-22 ). In countries like the United States, Germany, France, and Japan, approximately 43% of patients have experienced a failure of their preventive medication or have switched treatments. Among patients with episodic or chronic migraine who are undergoing oral preventative treatment, side effects and a lack of efficacy are the most common reasons for discontinuing their treatment. Prior treatments of migraine may leave significant numbers of patients without adequate treatment. For instance, up to 40% of migraine attacks, ~30% of patients, fail to respond to a particular triptan, because of suboptimal efficacy or tolerability issues (See  Dodick DW. Headache. 2005;45:156-162 , and  Tepper DE. Headache. 2013(53)577-578 ). Because of their vasoconstricting effects, these medications may have contraindications, warnings, and precautions for patients with cardiovascular risk factors and disease (See  Alwhaibi M, et al. Pain Res Treat. 2016; 2016:8538101 , and  Gilmore B, Michael M. Am Fam Physician. 2011(83)271-280 ). Thus, for prior monotherapy or dual therapy migraine prevention and/or treatments, a substantial fraction of patients may fail to achieve headache relief and/or freedom from pain in response to treatment or preventative therapy. Further, some patients, referred to herein as therapy resistant migraine patients, will fail to successfully manage their migraine attacks and will suffer from migraines which are refractory to two or more prior monotherapy and/or dual therapy prevention or treatment regimens. These inadequately controlled migraine patients may have a number of migraine days per-month that continues to be significantly disabling.", "true_sdg": "SDG3", "predicted_sdg": "SDG10", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 0.8351457118988037, "line_number": 298}

At present, the internationally approved targets for gastric cancer targeted therapy include human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the approved gastric cancer immunotherapy target is programmed lethal protein 1 (PD-1). In September 2017, based on the large-scale phase III clinical trial of ATTRACTION-2, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan approved the PD-1 antibody Opdivo for the treatment of patients with chemotherapy-resistant advanced gastric cancer: as compared with placebo, Opdivo could reduce the mortality rate by 37% and showed an effective rate of 11.2%. Based on the phase II clinical trial of Keynote 059, the US FDA has accelerated the approval of using PD-1 antibody Keytruda in treatment of chemotherapy-resistant PD-L1-positive advanced gastric cancer patients, showing an effective rate of 15.5%. In terms of targeted therapy, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) not only promotes tumor angiogenesis, but also binds to receptors on the surface of tumor cells to activate downstream signaling pathways and directly participates in the formation, occurrence and migration of tumor stem cells. Both the VEGFR2 inhibitors apatinib and ramucirumab have been clinically confirmed to be safe and effective for VEFR-targeted therapy of advanced gastric cancer of second-line and above. HER2 gene amplification or protein overexpression occurs in about 6% to 35% of new cases of gastric cancer each year, thus HER2 is one of the important targets in anticancer treatment. The TOGA phase III clinical trial first demonstrated the advantages of trastuzumab in the first-line treatment of HER2 (+) advanced gastric cancer, and the OS of the group treated with trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy was significantly longer than that of the group treated with chemotherapy alone (13.8 months vs. 11 Months), and the secondary endpoints including PFS, ORR (objective response rate) and TTP (time to progression) were also improved significantly. However, the proportion of HER2-positive patients in China is only about 10%, therefore it is imperative to explore new therapeutic targets for gastric cancer.", "true_sdg": "SDG3", "predicted_sdg": "SDG10", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 0.8854820728302002, "line_number": 313}

The first terminal T11 of the first power semiconductor S1 and the second terminal T22 of the second power semiconductor S2 are connected to the clamping component 40 through the second wiring layer 232 and the first wiring layer 231. Preferably but not exclusively, in the embodiment, the clamping component 40 is, for example, a clamping capacitor, which corresponds to the clamping capacitor Cin in the equivalent circuit diagram of  FIG. 5 . In the embodiment, with the clamping capacitor Cin disposed in the power module 2b, when the first power semiconductor S1 and the second power semiconductor S2 are turned off, the area corresponding to the high-frequency loop is reduced, and the parasitic inductance of the loop is reduced. If the clamping capacitor Cin is not disposed in the power module 2b, the loop parasitic inductance value is Lout+Lin. As the clamping capacitor Cin is disposed in the power module 2b, the loop parasitic inductance value becomes Lin, and the inductance value is reduced. Therefore, by disposing the clamping capacitor Cin in the loop, the parasitic inductance is reduced, as shown in  FIG. 4B .", "true_sdg": "None", "predicted_sdg": "SDG10", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 1.7271618843078613, "line_number": 332}

{"patent_number": "EP4240113A1", "description_number": 25, "description_text": "Further referring to  FIG. 3 ,  FIG. 4 ,  FIG. 5  and  FIG. 6 , the load is connected between the output terminal L_LOAD and the N line, when an overcurrent or short circuit occurs, the large current flows through the fuse F1, the primary side of the current transformer CT1, the field effect transistor Q1, the field effect transistor Q2, the load and the cable, etc., and then returns to the N line to form the entire circuit. When a large current flows through the primary side of the current transformer CT1, its secondary side coil will induce a current signal of equal proportion (actually 1000: 1), applying to the detection resistors R50 and R51, the greater the current, the voltage on the detection resistor (ISEN signal) will increase proportionally, the ISEN signal passes through the electronic rectifier composed of rectifier U7A and rectifier U7C (similar to the effect of rectifier diode, the advantage of electronic rectification is that there is no offset loss of PN junction, and the waveform is not distorted), the steamed bun wave of DC component is output at the 8th pin of the rectifier U7C, and then through the resistor R36, it is input to the positive input port of the comparator U7D (Pin 12 in the figures), and compared with the reference voltage of the negative input port (Pin 13 in the figures), if the voltage exceeds 2.667V, then the output port (Pin 14 in the figures) will output a high level, the base of the transistor Q7 is positively biased through the resistor R38, the collector and the emitter of the transistor Q7 are turned on, the base of the transistor Q8 becomes low level, the collector and the emitter of the transistor Q8 are turned on, the high level is added to the base of the transistor Q7 through the resistor R40, forcing the collector and the emitter of the transistor Q7 to continue to conduct; the collector of the transistor Q7 quickly pulls down the base of the transistor Q3 through the diode D8, the collector and emitter of the transistor Q3 are turned off, the collector and the emitter of the transistor Q4 are turned on, and the second and third pins of the driving optocoupler M1 are short-circuited. The 6th and 7th pins of the driving optocoupler M1 output a low level, and the gate voltages of the field effect transistor Q1 and the field effect transistor Q2 are low level, the drain and source of field effect transistor Q1 are cut off, the drain and source of field effect transistor Q2 are cut off, the output current is cut off, and the field effect transistor Q1 and field effect transistor Q2 are protected in time. The risk of damage due to overheating due to high current is avoided. However, in the actual circuit, due to the existence of the parasitic inductance and capacitive reactance of the cable at the load end (the LED drive power has input capacitance), at the moment when the large current is disconnected, the parasitic inductance will generate a back electromotive force, forming a voltage spike, which is superimposed on the drain and source ends of the field effect transistor Q1 and the drain and source ends of the field effect transistor Q2. At this time, the rectifier bridge stack BD2 will rectify this voltage spike and then charge the capacitor C37. Microscopically, the two ends of the capacitor are equivalent to a constant voltage source. Using the principle that the voltage across the large capacitor cannot change abruptly, during the charging process, the rising slope of the spike voltage is forced to become slow, and the high spike voltage is suppressed to break down the main power MOS transistor field effect transistor Q1 and field effect transistor Q2. Resistor R74 and resistor R78 discharge the capacitor C37, and at the same time connect the transient suppression diode TVS tube in parallel at both ends of the capacitor C37 (the voltage-stabilizing diode D2, voltage-stabilizing diode D4 and voltage-stabilizing diode D7 are connected in series), to prevent the load power and capacitive reactance from being too large, and to avoid the generated back electromotive force energy being larger, the voltage on the capacitor C37 will be higher. When the avalanche voltage of the TVS tube (i.e. voltage-stabilizing diode D2, voltage-stabilizing diode D4 and voltage-stabilizing diode D7) is exceeded, it will turn on and absorb the spike current and enter the clamping state. The clamping voltage is below the withstand voltage of field effect transistor Q 1 and field effect transistor Q2 of 650V, which realizes double protection of the main power transistor (i.e. field effect transistor Q1 and field effect transistor Q2). The other way of the collector of the transistor Q7 pulls down the third pin of the main control chip U200 through the diode D9, after the software program makes a judgment, it quickly enters the protection, forcing the first pin of the main control chip U200 to stop outputting the PWM waveform, which also stops the output of the dimmer, and the dimmer stops. After that, the program delays for one minute, restarts the work automatically, and outputs a high level of 2ms from the 48th pin of the main control chip U200, so that the collector and emitter of the transistor Q9 are turned on, and the base of the transistor Q7 is pulled down. The collector of the transistor Q7 becomes a high level, the collector and the emitter of the transistor Q8 are turned off, forming an unlock, and the dimmer can achieve dimming normally; if the short circuit is not removed, the BRCT clamping and absorbing circuit with short-circuit protection will continue to protect again, and so on, until the short-circuit is removed, the dimmer automatically resumes normal operation and can achieve dimming.", "true_sdg": "SDG9", "predicted_sdg": "SDG10", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 1.7537257671356201, "line_number": 343}

The first prefabricated substrate 10a includes a first upper metal layer 12a and a first lower metal layer 13a disposed on the upper surface and the lower surface of the first insulation layer 11a, respectively. The second prefabricated substrate 10b includes a second upper metal layer 12b and a second lower metal layer 13b disposed on the upper surface and the lower surface of the second insulation layer 11b, respectively.

The fourth prefabricated substrate 10d includes a fourth upper metal layer 12d and a fourth lower metal layer 13d disposed on the upper surface and the lower surface of the fourth insulation layer 11d, respectively. The first prefabricated substrate 10a and the second prefabricated substrate 10b are arranged in the horizontal direction for example on the XY planes direction, and are embedded in the circuit board body 20 to form the first surface 101 of the carrier board 1c.

In the embodiment, the first power semiconductor S1, the second power semiconductor S2 and the clamping element 40 are disposed on the first surface 101 of the carrier board 1c. The first power semiconductor S1 and the second power semiconductor S2 are disposed on the first prefabricated substrate 10a and the second prefabricated substrate 10b, respectively, and are connected to the first upper metal layer 12a and the second upper metal layer 12b, respectively. Moreover, the first power semiconductor S1 and the second power semiconductor S2 are connected in series through the second upper metal layer 12b and the first wiring layer 231, so as to form a bridge arm. The heat sink 50 and the second surface 102 of the carrier board 1c are connected through the thermal-conductive material. In the embodiment, the carrier board 1c further includes a third wiring layer 233. The third wiring layer 233 is disposed between the second prefabricated substrate 10b and the fourth prefabricated substrate 10d. Preferably but not exclusively, the third wiring layer 233 is connected to the second terminal T22 of second power semiconductor S2 through the via 234 disposed in the circuit board body 20. Corresponding to the equivalent circuit diagram of  FIG. 5 , the first terminal T11 of the first power semiconductor S1 is connected to a positive electrode P. The second terminal T22 of the second power semiconductor S2 is connected to the negative electrode N. The second terminal T12 of the first power semiconductor S1 and the first terminals T21 of the second power semiconductors S2 are connected to the output electrode O in common. In the embodiment, the third wiring layer 233 is connected to the negative electrode N and has an identical electric potential as the negative electrode N. There is a parasitic capacitance generated between the output electrode O and the heat sink 50, and there is a parasitic capacitance generated between the heat sink 50 and the control circuit (not shown). There is a low-impedance connection with the control circuit and the negative electrode N. In that, an electrical circuit loop is formed from the output electrode O to the heat sink 50, from the heat sink 50 to the control circuit, from the control circuit to the negative electrode N, and then from the negative electrode N to the output electrode O. When the voltage between the output electrode O and the negative electrode N is jumped, the above loop generates a common mode current, which generates a voltage drop in the control circuit. The voltage drop is superimposed on the control signal or the sampling signal to cause interference. In the embodiment, setting the third wiring layer 233 with the identical electric potential as the negative electrode N between the O electrode and the heat sink 50 is equivalent to connect a low impedance branch in parallel between the O electrode and the N electrode. Therefore, most of the common mode current is shunted to this branch. Thus, the voltage drop caused by the common-mode current on the control loop is reduced greatly, and the interference to the control signal and the sampling signal is avoided effectively.", "true_sdg": "None", "predicted_sdg": "SDG10", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 1.6879467964172363, "line_number": 355}

However, various limitations associated with their use have driven an increased interest in alternative methods, including biological approaches involving bacteria. The publication highlights that naturally occurring bacteria with antagonistic effects against the causative agent of fire blight have been identified in natural conditions. These bacteria possess the ability to protect plants from the disease. Research conducted in various countries has shown that the most effective species for biological control include Pantoea agglomerans, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus subtilis, and Lactobacillus plantarum. Extensive research on the application of various strains of P. agglomerans (formerly classified as Erwinia herbicola) for combating fire blight was conducted in the 1980s under the guidance of Professor S. V. Beer at Cornell University in New York state. This research is described in the publication:  S. V. Beer, J. R. Rundle, titled \"Suppression of Erwinia amylovora by Erwinia herbicola in immature pear fruits,\" published in Phytopathology (1983), Vol. 73, No. 9, pp. 1346-1346 . Introducing a suspension of bacteria onto apple blossoms one day before or three days after inoculation with E. amylovora showed that 52% and 25% of flowers, respectively, remained externally healthy. Similar efficacy (52% of symptom-free flowers) was observed after treatment with streptomycin, as described in another publication by  S. V. Beer and colleagues: \"Control of fire blight by non-pathogenic bacteria\" published in Phytopathology (1980), Vol. 70, No. 5, pp. 459-459 .", "true_sdg": "SDG3", "predicted_sdg": "SDG10", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 0.8002352714538574, "line_number": 359}

Such modifications include, e.g., modifications remote from the FcRn contact sites as well as modifications within the contact sites that preserve or even enhance binding to the FcRn. For example the following single amino acid residues in human IgG1 Fc (Fcy1) can be substituted without significant loss of Fc binding affinity for FcRn: P238A, S239A, K246A, K248A, D249A, M252A, T256A, E258A, T260A, D265A, S267A, H268A, E269A, D270A, E272A, L274A, N276A, Y278A, D280A, V282A, E283A, H285A, N286A, T289A, K290A, R292A, E293A, E294A, Q295A, Y296F, N297A, S298A, Y300F, R301A, V303A, V305A, T307A, L309A, Q311A, D312A, N315A, K317A, E318A, K320A, K322A, S324A, K326A, A327Q, P329A, A330Q, A330S, P331A, P331S, E333A, K334A, T335A, S337A, K338A, K340A, Q342A, R344A, E345A, Q347A, R355A, E356A, M358A, T359A, K360A, N361A, Q362A, Y373A, S375A D376A, A378Q, E380A, E382A, S383A, N384A, Q386A, E388A, N389A, N390A, Y391F, K392A, L398A, S400A, D401A, D413A, K414A, R416A, Q418A, Q419A, N421A, V422A, S424A, E430A, N434A, T437A, Q438A, K439A, S440A, S444A, and K447A, where for example P238A represents wildtype proline substituted by alanine at position number 238. In addition to alanine other amino acids may be substituted for the wildtype amino acids at the positions specified above. Mutations may be introduced singly into Fc giving rise to more than one hundred FcRn binding partners distinct from native Fc. Additionally, combinations of two, three, or more of these individual mutations may be introduced together, giving rise to hundreds more FcRn binding partners. Certain of these mutations may confer new functionality upon the FcRn binding partner. For example, one embodiment incorporates N297A, removing a highly conserved N-glycosylation site. The effect of this mutation is to reduce immunogenicity, thereby enhancing circulating half-life of the FcRn binding partner, and to render the FcRn binding partner incapable of binding to FcyRI, FcyRIIA, FcyRIIB, and FcyRIIIA, without compromising affinity for FcRn ( Routledge et al. 1995, Transplantation 60:847 , which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety;  Friend et al. 1999, Transplantation 68:1632 , which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety;  Shields et al. 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591 , which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Additionally, at least three human Fc gamma receptors appear to recognize a binding site on IgG within the lower hinge region, generally amino acids 234-237. Therefore, another example of new functionality and potential decreased immunogenicity may arise from mutations of this region, as for example by replacing amino acids 233-236 of human IgG1 \"ELLG\" to the corresponding sequence from IgG2 \"PVA\" (with one amino acid deletion). It has been shown that FcyRI, FcyRII, and FcyRIII which mediate various effector functions will not bind to IgG1 when such mutations have been introduced ( Ward and Ghetie 1995, Therapeutic Immunology 2:77 , which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; and  Armour et al.1999, Eur. J. Immunol. 29:2613 , which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). As a further example of new functionality arising from mutations described above affinity for FcRn may be increased beyond that of wild type in some instances. This increased affinity may reflect an increased \"on\" rate, a decreased \"off\" rate or both an increased \"on\" rate and a decreased \"off\" rate. Mutations believed to impart an increased affinity for FcRn include, e.g., T256A, T307A, E380A, and N434A ( Shields et al. 2001, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591 , which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).", "true_sdg": "SDG3", "predicted_sdg": "SDG10", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 1.7332534790039062, "line_number": 375}

{"patent_number": "EP4332726A2", "description_number": 448, "description_text": "In some embodiments, in response to detecting the first input by the first contact on the touch-sensitive surface (1110): in accordance with a determination that the first input meets first expansion-hint criteria, wherein the first expansion-hint criteria require that a location of the first contact on the touch-sensitive surface corresponds to a portion of the first control region, the device displays visual feedback (e.g., an animation) that includes dynamically changing an appearance of the first control region in accordance with a change in an intensity parameter (e.g., intensity or rate of change in intensity) of the first contact (e.g., as shown in  Figure 5C14 ) (e.g., when the intensity of the contact changes, the appearance of the first control region and/or the appearance of the control panel user interface outside the first control region are dynamically changed in accordance with a magnitude of the changes in the intensity of the first contact, and/or in accordance with a rate by which the intensity of the first contact changes). In some embodiments, the first visual effect is a \"springy\" animation (e.g., an animation that oscillates back and forth in a virtual z-direction by an amount that is based on the detected intensity of the first contact or the rate of change of the intensity of the first contact). The first visual effect indicates that if the intensity of the first contact continues to increase and exceeds the first intensity threshold, the first control region will be expanded (e.g., \"popped open\") to display additional controls. In some embodiments, the first visual effect includes dynamically changing a size of the first control region in accordance with the change in the intensity parameter of the first contact (e.g., increasing the size with increasing intensity of the first contact). In some embodiments, the first visual effect includes dynamically deemphasizing portions of the control panel user interface outside of the first control region in accordance with the change in the intensity parameter of the first contact (e.g., increasing an amount of blurring and darkening applied to the portions of the control panel user interface outside of the first control region with increasing intensity of the first contact). In some embodiments, the visual feedback indicating that the first control region is sensitive to intensity-based inputs is displayed even when the input does not trigger an intensity-based operation (e.g., displaying an expanded control region). For example, the visual feedback is displayed in accordance with a determination that the first input meets first expansion-hint criteria, wherein the first expansion-hint criteria require that a location of the first contact on the touch-sensitive surface corresponds to an unoccupied portion of the first control region (e.g., a region that is not occupied by any controls) and the first expansion-hint criteria do not require that an intensity of the first contact exceed the first intensity threshold in order for the first expansion-hint criteria to be met. In some embodiments, the visual feedback is displayed whether a location of the first contact on the touch-sensitive surface corresponds to an unoccupied portion of the first control region (e.g., as shown in  Figure 5C25 ) or a location of the first contact on the touch-sensitive surface corresponds to location of a control in the first control region (e.g., as shown in  Figure 5C14 ). Dynamically changing an appearance of a control region in accordance with a change in intensity of a corresponding contact provides improved feedback which enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by indicating that the control region is sensitive to intensity-based inputs, and thereby helping the user to achieve an intended outcome with the required inputs) which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.", "true_sdg": "None", "predicted_sdg": "SDG15", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 1.3507964611053467, "line_number": 385}

As used herein, \"asynchronous\" means to stimulate each vibrating element 104 in an alternating manner with some period of overlap where both stimulating elements are vibrating simultaneously. The overlap area may begin randomly or may be programed as will be discussed below. The vibrating elements 104 alter the brain's internal communication in multiple areas including the somatosensory cortex and other brain networks. This interferes with the brain's ability to activate the sympathetic nervous system and therefore reduces the stress response. By applying the bi-lateral and asynchronous stimulation to the individual's body, the individual experiences a reduction in stress and a lessening of distressing body sensations (e.g., racing heartbeat, stomach aches). Because the brain can activate sympathetic arousal in hundreds of milliseconds (or faster via the brain's primitive routes of processing), the overlap period provides an advantage over conventional bi-lateral stimulators in ensuring that any stimulation gap commonly used in conventional bi-lateral stimulators will not allow the brain to activate the sympathetic system.

Conjoint administration may be accomplished by administration of a single co-formulation, by simultaneous administration, or by administration at separate times. ALK7:ActRIIB antagonists may be particularly advantageous if administered with other bone-active agents. A patient may benefit from conjointly receiving an ALK7:ActRIIB antagonist complex and taking calcium supplements, vitamin D, appropriate exercise and/or, in some cases, other medication. Examples of other medications incude, bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate and risedronate), calcitonin, estrogens, parathyroid hormone and raloxifene. The bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate and risedronate), calcitonin, estrogens and raloxifene affect the bone remodeling cycle and are classified as anti-resorptive medications. Bone remodeling consists of two distinct stages: bone resorption and bone formation. Anti-resorptive medications slow or stop the bone-resorbing portion of the bone-remodeling cycle but do not slow the bone-forming portion of the cycle. As a result, new formation continues at a greater rate than bone resorption, and bone density may increase over time. Teriparatide, a form of parathyroid hormone, increases the rate of bone formation in the bone remodeling cycle. Alendronate is approved for both the prevention (5 mg per day or 35 mg once a week) and treatment (10 mg per day or 70 mg once a week) of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Alendronate reduces bone loss, increases bone density and reduces the risk of spine, wrist and hip fractures. Alendronate also is approved for treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and women as a result of long-term use of these medications (i.e., prednisone and cortisone) and for the treatment of osteoporosis in men. Alendronate plus vitamin D is approved for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (70 mg once a week plus vitamin D), and for treatment to improve bone mass in men with osteoporosis. Ibandronate is approved for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Taken as a once-a-month pill (150 mg), ibandronate should be taken on the same day each month. Ibandronate reduces bone loss, increases bone density and reduces the risk of spine fractures. Risedronate is approved for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Taken daily (5 mg dose) or weekly (35 mg dose or 35 mg dose with calcium), risedronate slows bone loss, increases bone density and reduces the risk of spine and non-spine fractures. Risedronate also is approved for use by men and women to prevent and/or treat glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis that results from long-term use of these medications (i.e., prednisone or cortisone). Calcitonin is a naturally occurring hormone involved in calcium regulation and bone metabolism. In women who are more than 5 years beyond menopause, calcitonin slows bone loss, increases spinal bone density, and may relieve the pain associated with bone fractures. Calcitonin reduces the risk of spinal fractures. Calcitonin is available as an injection (50-100 IU daily) or nasal spray (200 IU daily).", "true_sdg": "SDG3", "predicted_sdg": "SDG3", "is_correct": true, "prediction_time": 1.3393151760101318, "line_number": 785}

When estrogen is taken alone, it can increase a woman's risk of developing cancer of the uterine lining (endometrial cancer). To eliminate this risk, healthcare providers prescribe the hormone progestin in combination with estrogen (hormone replacement therapy or HT) for those women who have an intact uterus.

Generally, an individual sitting or reclining on a piece of furniture is par-stationary meaning that the individual is not mobile but may move or reposition him/herself on the furniture so as not to be considered fully stationary.  FIG. 43  illustrates a chair having various stimulation elements 104 incorporated into the seat, lumbar area and back of the chair. The chair can be a kitchen chair, desk chair reclining chair or a so-called \"easy chair\" as illustrated in  FIG. 43 . In furniture embodiments, it may be advantageous to employ stimulation elements arranged in arrays as discussed in connection with  FIG. 14  above. Moreover, the stimulation elements may incorporate the pressure sensor 212 as discussed above in connection with  FIG. 15 . Sofas are another article of furniture into which the stimulation elements 104 can be incorporated. Since multiple individuals may sit in a sofa the present disclosure contemplates that one individual may activate one array 4400 via his mobile device and another individual may activate another stimulation element array 4402 by her mobile device. This configuration may be useful in sectional sofas, loveseats or other multi-person furniture. Desks and tables are another article of furniture into which the stimulation elements 104 can be incorporated. As illustrated in  FIG. 45  stimulation elements may be built into the desktop so that the individual seated at the desk can place her/his hands over the stimulation element to receive the therapeutic benefit at any time during the day or evening. Children in pediatric embodiments are also contemplated by the present disclosure. As illustrated in  FIG. 46 , stimulation elements 104 can be incorporated into a child's stool which can benefit the child by reducing stress and increasing concentration to keep the child on-task during an activity. Additionally, the stool could be used to reduce stress and anxiety during a minor disciplinary action such as a \"timeout\". Pillows and mattresses also provide an excellent platform for incorporating the stimulation elements 104 for evening relaxation. As illustrated in  FIG. 47 , stimulation elements can be built into a pillow or can be built into a pillow cover into which the pillow is inserted. Depending on the individuals sleep position, the mobile device can activate stimulation array 4700 or 4702 depending upon the pressure sensor readings provided by the pressure sensor 212 (see  FIG. 15 ) to provide bilateral stimulation to the individuals head.  FIG. 48  illustrates a mattress having an array of sensors positioned along either side of the mattress. One or more sensors in the bilateral array can be activated depending upon the pressure sensor readings provided by the pressure sensor 212 so that those vibrating elements 104 that are not in therapeutic contact with the individual do not vibrate and waste energy.

{"patent_number": "EP3872093A1", "description_number": 4, "description_text": "Claudin is a transmembrane protein complex within the tight junctions of epithelia and endothelia and located on the top side of the gap between adjacent cells. Its distribution is tissue and organ specific, and its functions mainly include cell adhesion, maintaining cell polarity, regulating paracellular permeability, and participating in regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. Claudin18 molecule is a tetraspanin with four transmembrane hydrophobic regions and two extracellular loops, and exists as two different splice variants CLDN18.1 and CLDN18.2. CLDN18.1 and CLDN18.2 differ in sequence at the N-terminus of intracellular region and the first extracellular loop, but share the same protein primary sequence at the other parts. The tissue distribution of CLDN18 shows that CLDN18.1 is only selectively expressed on lung cells, while CLDN18.2 is only expressed on gastric cells, and the expression of CLDN18.2 in normal stomach is limited to differentiated short-lived gastric epithelium cells. CLDN18.2 is frequently retained during the malignant transformation of gastric cells, and is therefore frequently displayed on the surface of human gastric cancer cells, and 60% to 80% of gastrointestinal adenomas are CLDN18.2-positive ( Clinical Cancer Research 2008, 14 (23): 7624-34 ). In addition, CLDN18.2 is highly expressed in pancreatic duct cancer and metastatic pancreatic cancer, with a positive rate of 60-70%, and thus can be used as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for pancreatic duct/pancreatic cancer ( Journal of Clinical Pathology 2012, 65: 431- 436 ;  World Journal of Gastroenterology 2014, 20 (31): 10813-10824 ;  International Journal of Cancer 2014, 134: 731-739 ). There is no intensive research on ectopic activation of CLDN18.2 in other tumors, and currently available documents show that in addition to the aforementioned ectopic activation in pancreatic cancer, this protein is also expressed in esophageal cancer, bronchial cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, ENT tumor, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer and metastases thereof, especially in gastric cancer metastases such as Krukenberg tumor, peritoneal metastases and lymph node metastases ( Clinical Cancer Research 2008, 14 (23): 7624-34 ;  International Journal of Cancer 2014, 134: 731-739 ;  Cancer Letters 2017, 403: 66-73 ;  International Journal of Cancer 2014, 135 (9): 2206-2214 ). CLDN18.2 is a tumor target with preventive and therapeutic value, and its differential expression between cancer cells and normal cells, its membrane localization, its absence from most toxicity-relevant normal tissues, and the restriction of its expression in the stomach to differentiated gastric cells that can be replenished by target-negative stem cells (or positionally inaccessible stem cells) of the stomach, make CLDN18.2 be as an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy.

{"patent_number": "EP3916103A1", "description_number": 100, "description_text": "Framework residues in the human framework regions may be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g.,  Queen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089 ;  Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323 (1988 ), which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.) Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the consensus and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding. Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art, such as but not limited to those described in  Jones et al., Nature 321:522 (1986 );  Verhoeyen et al., Science 239:1534 (1988 )),  Sims et al., J.

{"patent_number": "EP4425316A2", "description_number": 255, "description_text": "In certain embodiments, an example VT circuit 1112 applies a gradient formatting option 1410 to one or more aspects of the second view 1122. For example, the VT circuit 1112 determines boundary values each associated with a formatting option 1410 (e.g., a minimum and maximum value, each having an associated color), and applies gradations of the formatting option 1410 for values between the boundaries. The gradations may be applied according to the values between (e.g., a value close to one of the boundaries includes a formatting option 1410 having a value close to the boundary formatting option 1410), applied in order (e.g., selected steps between boundary options in data sorted order, regardless of the specific relationship of values to the boundary values, where the selected steps may be linear (e.g., equal size steps) or another relationship such as logarithmic, exponential, or the like). In certain embodiments, boundary values and formatting options 1410 may be selected automatically (e.g., from the highest and/or lowest values), selected by a user, updated in real time (e.g., boundaries change as data updates change the highest and/or lowest values), and/or fixed or updated periodically or in a user selected fashion. In certain embodiments, gradation formatting options 1410 may be extrapolated outside the boundary values, capped or limited at the boundary value formatting options 1410 for values that are outside the boundary values, and/or a distinct formatting option (e.g., a different color, a default color, etc.) may be applied for values that are outside the boundary values. In certain embodiments, where values are outside the boundary values, the user may be prompted for an action (e.g., treatment type such as extrapolation, capping, applying a distinct format, and/or moving the boundary out to a new limit), and/or automatic action may be taken (e.g., according to defaults, rules defined by a user, template, and/or administrator, according to a data type (e.g., font colors capped at the boundaries, while font sizes are extrapolated)) outside the boundary values. In certain embodiments, more than one gradation may be applied to a data element 1108, for example both a font size and a font color may have gradations. The described examples of a gradient formatting option 1410 and operations related thereto, are non-limiting examples for purposes of illustration. Without limitation, examples of gradation formatting options 1410 include font colors, font sizes, line thickness values, highlighting and/or background colors, line colors, chart colors, and/or data grouping values (e.g., a data set grouped by graduated time frames such as days near a first boundary and years near a second boundary). One of skill in the art, having the benefit of the disclosure herein and knowledge ordinarily available contemplating a particular system, can readily determine gradient formatting options 1410 and related operations thereto. Example and non-limiting considerations to determine gradient formatting options 1410 and related operations thereto include the type of data element 1108, the type of document 1106, characteristics of the user 814, purpose of the second view 1122, the type of formatting utilized for the gradient formatting option 1410, and/or the size and/or variability within a graduated data set (either by design or as observed based on real-time data).", "true_sdg": "None", "predicted_sdg": "SDG16", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 1.2092945575714111, "line_number": 917}

In a case, as shown in Table 9-1, the first network slice identifier is the same as the second network slice identifier and is a slice A. The management device determines, based on the information obtained in steps 201 to 203, that a seventh network slice topology includes the identifier of the first sub-interface, and the identifier of the second sub-interface that are corresponding to the slice A, and an identifier of the direct link between the first sub-interface and the second sub-interface. The link identifier may further be identified as \"first device-second device\". In this case, if a network slice identifier corresponding to either of a port (for example, referred to as the first port) to which the first sub-interface belongs and a port (for example, referred to as the second port) to which the second sub-interface belongs is a slice A, the seventh network topology may further include the identifier of the first port and the identifier of the second port. In another case, as shown in Table 9-2, the first network slice identifier and the second network slice identifier are a slice A and a slice B respectively. It may be understood that a first network slice is different from a second network slice, and the first sub-interface and the second sub-interface belong to different network slices. The management device determines an eighth network slice topology and a ninth network slice topology based on the information obtained in steps 201 to 203. An identifier of the eighth network slice topology is the first network slice identifier slice A, and an identifier of the ninth network slice topology is the second network slice identifier slice B. The eighth network slice topology includes the identifier of the first sub-interface, and the ninth network slice topology includes the identifier of the second sub-interface. In this case, if every network slice identifier corresponding to the port (for example, referred to as the first port) to which the first sub-interface belongs is the slice A, and every network slice identifier corresponding to the port (for example, referred to as the second port) to which the second sub-interface belongs is the slice B, the eighth network topology may further include the identifier of the first port, and the ninth network topology may further include the identifier of the second port.\nTable 9-1 \n<tb>Content of the seventh network slice topology\n<tb>Network slice identifier<SEP>Identifier of the first port<SEP>Identifier of the first sub-interface<SEP>Identifier of the second port<SEP>Identifier of the second sub-interface<SEP>Identifier of the link between the first port and the second port\n<tb>Slice A<SEP>Port ID-A<SEP>VLAN ID-A<SEP>Port ID-B<SEP>VLAN ID-B<SEP>Port ID-A-Port ID-B\nTable 9-2 \n<tb>Content of the eighth network slice topology\n<tb>Network slice identifier<SEP>Identifier of the port to which the first sub-interface belongs<SEP>Identifier of the first sub-interface\n<tb>Slice A<SEP>Port ID-A<SEP>VLAN ID-A\n<tb>Content of the ninth network slice topology\n<tb>Network slice identifier<SEP>Identifier of the port to which the second sub-interface belongs<SEP>Identifier of the first sub-interface\n<tb>Slice B<SEP>Port ID-B<SEP>VLAN ID-B", "true_sdg": "None", "predicted_sdg": "SDG16", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 1.3298652172088623, "line_number": 918}

Figure 12A  shows ADCC activity in Jurkat cells engineered to express CTLA-4 on the cell surface, when incubated with AGEN1884.H3 (IgG1), AGEN1884.H3 (IgGi N297A), AGEN1884.H3 (IgGi S239D/A330L/I332E), AGEN1884.H3 (IgGi S267E/L328F), afucosylated AGEN1884.H3 (IgG1), or an isotype control antibody (IgG1).  Figure 12B  shows ADCC activity in primary human activated effector T cells (left panel) or regulatory T cells (right panel) when incubated with these antibodies.\nFigures 13A, 13B, 13C, and 13D are graphs showing the effects of anti-CTLA-4 antibody variants on T cell function when administered alone or in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody. Human PBMCs were isolated from two donors and incubated under stimulatory culture conditions with anti-CTLA-4 antibody AGEN1884.H3 (IgG1), an Fc variant anti-CTLA-4 antibody AGEN1884.H3 (IgGi S239D/A330L/I332E), or an isotype control antibody (IgG1), in combination with a reference anti-PD-1 antibody or an isotype control antibody (IgG4), as indicated. For each treatment condition listed, a dosage titration was used for the first-listed antibody, and a fixed concentration (5 µg/ml) was used for the second-listed antibody. This experiment was performed twice, for a total of two replicates per donor. The levels of IL-2 production induced by each antibody combination on PBMCs collected from the first donor are shown in  Figure 13A  (replicate 1) and  Figure 13B  (replicate 2). The levels of IL-2 production induced by each antibody combination on PBMCs collected from the second donor are shown in  Figure 13C  (replicate 1) and  Figure 13D  (replicate 2).\nFigures 14A,14B, and 14C are a series of sequence alignments.  Figure 14A  is a sequence alignment for human CTLA-4 (SEQ ID NO: 33), cynomolgus monkey CTLA-4 (SEQ ID NO: 40), mouse CTLA-4 (SEQ ID NO: 41), and rat CTLA-4 (SEQ ID NO: 42). Dots represent residues identical to corresponding human residues. An \"*\" (asterisk) indicates positions which have a single, fully conserved residue. A \":\" (colon) indicates conservation between groups of strongly similar properties. A \".\" (period) indicates conservation between groups of weakly similar properties.  Figures 14B  and  14C  are sequence alignments for human CTLA-4 (residues 1-144 and residues 145-223 of SEQ ID NO: 33, respectively), cynomolgus monkey CTLA-4 (residues 1-144 and residues 145-223 of SEQ ID NO: 40, respectively), human CD28 (residues 1-127 and residues 128-220 of SEQ ID NO: 43, respectively), human ICOS (residues 1-124 and residues 125-199 of SEQ ID NO: 44, respectively), human BTLA (residues 1-125 and residues 126-289 of SEQ ID NO: 45, respectively), and human PD-1 (residues 1-143 and residues 144-288 of SEQ ID NO: 46, respectively). The two regions showing strong decrease in deuterium uptake when human CTLA-4 was bound to AGEN1884-Fab are underlined in  Figures 14A-14C : residues 80-82 (QVT, SEQ ID NO: 39) and residues 135-149 (YPPPYYLGIGNGTQI, SEQ ID NO: 37), numbered according to SEQ ID NO: 33.", "true_sdg": "None", "predicted_sdg": "None", "is_correct": true, "prediction_time": 1.7216699123382568, "line_number": 1252}

In case the valve (11) provided at the water inlet (10) does not allow water to be taken into the tub (9) through the discharge line (14) and the first household appliance (2) is operated, the condensate fills into the discharge line (14) such that the water level in the discharge line (14) reaches the tank (7) and the tank (7) is filled with the condensate. By means of the second outlet port (18) provided on the connection member (17), the condensate in the discharge line (14) passes through the second outlet port (18) and fills into the second discharge line (20), one end of which is connected to the second outlet port (18). The other end of the second discharge line (20) is connected to the valve (19) provided on the body (4). Thus, the valve (19) acts as a plug and prevents the condensate from overflowing from the second discharge line (20).

Thus, when the second household appliance (3) is not in operation, more condensate is accumulated by means of the second discharge line (20). Moreover, when the valve (19) is disposed on the side wall towards the front of the body (4), the user can easily reach the valve (19) from the front of the second household appliance (3).

The method is performed at a destination interface device, 506, and comprises splitting, 202, an incoming traffic into a third path carrying a native ethernet traffic encapsulated in an IP, internet protocol, packets and a fourth path carrying an IP traffic. The destination interface device, 506, receives the traffic over the 3GPP wireless network, 520, which, as previously described, in a preferred embodiment may be a 4G or 5G network. The packets of the traffic are addressed with IP address of the 3GPP wireless network interface of the destination interface device, 506. In the examples illustrated in  figures 5, 6  and  7  this IP address is 10.10.10.2. The received packets are further addressed with port numbers that allows for distinguishing traffic for different robots, 508 - 512, connected to the destination interface device, 506, as well as traffic that contains encapsulated ethernet frames. The part of the received traffic that carries encapsulated ethernet frames use port numbers assigned to a decapsulation function. Additionally, for some types of encapsulation the headers of traffic carrying encapsulated ethernet frames comprise encapsulation ID (e.g. VNI in the case of VxLAN encapsulation). If the VxLAN encapsulation is used, the encapsulated native ethernet traffic is defined by the VxLAN identifier (VNI) and the IP address and port of the VxLAN. In this case the traffic splitter behaves like a router. The packets with IP address and port associated to a VxLAN are routed towards the decapsulation function, while the rest of the IP traffic is sent to the TCP/UDP queueing system. Optionally, the traffic splitter can also check the VxLAN identifier, in case of the setting up of more than one VxLAN, situation typically occurring in correspondence of the PLC side. Therefore, the operation of splitting in one embodiment may forward onto the third path (and to the decapsulation function) the packets with the port number assigned to the decapsulation function or, in an alternative embodiment, the operation of splitting may forward IP packets containing the encapsulation ID (e.g. VNI) to the third path.

{"patent_number": "EP3786218A1", "description_number": 3, "description_text": "In the manufacture of the fiber reinforced composite, a prepreg is often used. The prepreg is an intermediate base material containing a unidirectional material including a reinforcing fiber aligned in one direction or a sheet-like material such as a woven fabric or a non-woven fabric, and a thermosetting resin impregnated into the unidirectional material or the sheet-like material. In general, a fiber reinforced composite manufactured by a prepreg method exhibits excellent mechanical properties because the arrangement of the reinforcing fiber is precisely controlled. Meanwhile, as the application of the carbon fiber has expanded in recent years, various molding methods have been developed in accordance with the application. In addition to the prepreg, methods using a liquid resin, such as a hand lay up method, a filament winding method, a pultrusion method, and a resin transfer molding (RTM) method are attracting attention. Among them, the filament winding method is a method preferably used for manufacturing hollow containers and cylinders. In the conventional method of impregnating a fiber with a liquid resin on the spot and winding the fiber around a mandrel (a wet method), however, there are problems that it is difficult to increase the winding speed because the liquid resin is scattered, and that the impregnated state tends to be uneven and the original strength of the reinforcing fiber may not be exhibited. As a material that can solve the problem, a narrow intermediate base material called a towpreg, a tow prepreg, a yarn prepreg, or a strand prepreg (hereinafter referred to as a towpreg), which includes a reinforcing fiber bundle in which thousands to tens of thousands of filaments are arranged in one direction and a thermosetting resin pre-impregnated into the reinforcing fiber bundle, is attracting attention.", "true_sdg": "SDG9", "predicted_sdg": "None", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 0.6893887519836426, "line_number": 1348}

{"patent_number": "EP3871518A1", "description_number": 123, "description_text": "At least the following matters are described in the present description. Corresponding components in the above-described embodiments are shown in parentheses, without being limited thereto.\n(1) A power supply unit (a power supply unit 10) for an aerosol inhaler (an aerosol inhaler 1) that causes an aerosol generated from an aerosol source (an aerosol source 22) heated by a first load (a first load 21) to pass through a flavor source (a flavor source 33) heated by a second load (a second load 31) to add a flavor component of the flavor source to the aerosol, the power supply unit including:\na power supply (a power supply 12) configured to be dischargeable to the first load and the second load; and\na processing device (an MCU 50),\nin which the processing device is configured to control discharging from the power supply to the first load in response to a signal from a first sensor (an intake sensor 15 or an operation unit 14) configured to output the signal indicating an aerosol generation request,\nin which the processing device is configured to control discharging from the power supply to the second load such that a temperature of the flavor source converges to a target temperature based on an output of a second sensor (a temperature detection element T1 or a temperature detection element T3) configured to output information on a temperature of the flavor source, and\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature based on a cumulative number of times (suction times) of discharging to the first load in response to the signal or a cumulative time (a cumulative discharging time) of discharging to the first load in response to the signal.According to (1), since the target temperature of the flavor source is increased based on a parameter (the cumulative times or the cumulative time) indicating consumption of the flavor source, it is possible to stabilize an amount of a flavor component provided to a user for each suction of the aerosol while performing simple control. As a result, a commercial value of the aerosol inhaler can be increased.\n(2) The power supply unit according to (1),\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature in stages based on the cumulative number of times or the cumulative time.\nAccording to (2), frequent changes in the target temperature are prevented by gradually increasing the target temperature. Therefore, it is possible to execute control more stably while performing simple control.\n(3) The power supply unit according to (2),\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature in three or more stages based on the cumulative number of times or the cumulative time.\nAccording to (3), since the target temperature is gradually increased at an appropriate frequency, it is possible to prevent the frequent changes in the target temperature and further stabilize the amount of the flavor component provided to the user.\n(4) The power supply unit according to (2) or (3),\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature in stages in a temperature increment of 5°C or higher and 15°C or lower based on the cumulative times or the cumulative time.\nAccording to (4), since the target temperature is gradually increased at an appropriate value, it is possible to prevent an increase in power consumption and deterioration of the power supply due to the frequent changes in the target temperature.\n(5) The power supply unit according to (2) or (3),\nin which the processing device is configured to acquire a temperature of the flavor source with a predetermined resolution based on an output of the second sensor, and\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature in stages in a temperature increment of five times or more and fifteen times or less of the resolution based on the cumulative number of times or the cumulative time.\nAccording to (5), the target temperature is gradually increased by a value sufficiently larger than the acquisition resolution of the temperature of the flavor source. Therefore, it is unnecessary to devise ways to reduce the resolution, and a manufacturing cost of the aerosol inhaler can be reduced. Further, the frequent changes in the target temperature due to noise larger than the resolution can be prevented.\n(6) The power supply unit according to (1),\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature such that a period during which the highest target temperature is applied is the longest.\nAccording to (6), the period during which the highest target temperature is applied is the longest. Therefore, it is possible to stabilize the amount of the flavor component by preventing the amount of the flavor component provided to the user from decreasing. Further, since the target temperature is prevented from reaching a high temperature due to frequent increases in the target temperature, an increase in power consumption and the flavor source falling into an overheated state can be avoided.\n(7) The power supply unit according to (1),\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature such that a period during which the lowest target temperature is applied is not the shortest.\nAccording to (7), the period during which the lowest target temperature is applied is not the shortest. Therefore, power consumption required for heating the flavor source can be suppressed.\n(8) The power supply unit according to (1),\nin which the lowest target temperature is included in a normal temperature.\nAccording to (8), since the flavor source can also be prevented from being heated at the start of use of the aerosol inhaler, the power consumption required for heating the flavor source can be further suppressed.\n(9) The power supply unit according to (1),\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature based on the cumulative time, to control discharging from the power supply to the first load such that a time for discharging to the first load per aerosol generation request is equal to or smaller than a predetermined time (a first default value tupper), and to apply a width of the cumulative time not less than two times the predetermined time to at least one value of the target temperature.\nAccording to (9), aerosol generation can be performed a plurality of times at one target temperature. Therefore, the frequent changes in the target temperature are prevented. Therefore, it is possible to execute control more stably while performing simple control.\n(10) The power supply unit according to (1),\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature based on the cumulative times, and to apply two or more values of the cumulative number of times to at least one value of the target temperature.\nAccording to (10), the aerosol generation can be performed the plurality of times at one target temperature. Therefore, the frequent changes in the target temperature are prevented. Therefore, it is possible to execute control more stably while performing simple control.\n(11) The power supply unit according to (1),\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature based on the cumulative time and to maintain the target temperature while discharging is performed from the power supply to the first load.\nAccording to (11), the target temperature is maintained during the aerosol generation. Therefore, it is possible to prevent an increase in power discharged to the second load during the aerosol generation. Therefore, sufficient power can be discharged to the first load while avoiding deterioration of the power supply due to discharging of a large current. Further, control can be simplified.\n(12) The power supply unit according to (1),\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature based on the cumulative time and to also increase the target temperature according to the cumulative time while discharging is performed from the power supply to the first load.\nAccording to (12), the target temperature can be changed during the aerosol generation. Therefore, the amount of the flavor component provided to the user for each suction of the aerosol and during suction can be stabilized, and the commercial value can be further increased.\n(13) The power supply unit according to (12),\nin which when the target temperature is increased while discharging is performed from the power supply to the first load, the processing device alternately performs discharging from the power supply to the first load and discharging from the power supply to the second load for causing a temperature of the flavor source to converge to the increased target temperature.\nAccording to (13), it is possible to prevent the two loads from being discharged at the same time. Therefore, it is possible to sufficiently discharge the two loads in order to stabilize the amount of the flavor component provided to the user, while avoiding the deterioration of the power supply due to the discharging of the large current.\n(14) The power supply unit according to (12),\nin which when the target temperature is increased while discharging is performed from the power supply to the first load, the processing device increases power discharged from the power supply to the first load.\nAccording to (14), the power discharged to the first load is increased when the target temperature is changed during the aerosol generation. Therefore, even when the flavor source does not reach the target temperature, the amount of the flavor component added to the aerosol can be increased by increasing the aerosol. As a result, the amount of the flavor component provided to the user for each suction of the aerosol and during suction can be stabilized, and the commercial value can be further increased.\n(15) The power supply unit according to (1),\nin which the processing device is configured to control discharging of power from the power supply to the first load such that a time for discharging to the first load per aerosol generation request is equal to or smaller than a predetermined time (a first default value tupper), and\nin which the processing device increases the target temperature when a difference between the cumulative time and a time threshold before discharging to the first load in response to the signal is less than the predetermined time, and maintains the target temperature when the difference is equal to or larger than the predetermined time.\nAccording to (15), if the amount of the flavor component contained in the aerosol decreases at next suction, the target temperature of the flavor source is increased in advance. Therefore, the amount of the flavor component added to the aerosol for each suction and during suction can be stabilized.\n(16) A power supply unit for an aerosol inhaler that causes an aerosol generated from an aerosol source for which at least heating of the heating and cooling is performed by a first load to pass through a flavor source for which at least heating of the heating and cooling is performed by a second load to add a flavor component of the flavor source to the aerosol, the power supply unit including:\na power supply configured to be dischargeable to the first load and the second load; and\na processing device,\nin which the processing device is configured to control discharging from the power supply to the first load in response to a signal from a first sensor configured to output the signal indicating an aerosol generation request,\nin which the processing device is configured to control discharging from the power supply to the second load such that a temperature of the flavor source converges to a target temperature based on an output of a second sensor configured to output information on a temperature of the flavor source, and\nin which the processing device is configured to increase the target temperature based on a cumulative number of times of discharging to the first load in response to the signal or a cumulative time of discharging to the first load in response to the signal.\n(17) An aerosol inhaler including:\nthe power supply unit according to any one of (1) to (16);\nthe aerosol source;\nthe flavor source;\nthe first load;\nthe second load;\nthe first sensor; and\nthe second sensor.", "true_sdg": "None", "predicted_sdg": "SDG12", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 1.7157084941864014, "line_number": 1456}

{"patent_number": "EP3916976A1", "description_number": 4, "description_text": "With their negligible or non-existent reverse recovery loss, wide-bandgap devices have enabled more common use of the totem-pole configuration in AC-DC converters. In AC-DC converters, as the totem-pole DC output voltage is higher than the peak AC input voltage, the minimum voltage gain is limited to one. In applications where the input voltage is very low, controlled switches S1 and S2 must operate at an excessively high duty-cycle to regulate DC output voltage VO, which increases conduction losses and reduces circuit efficiency. Hence, there is a need for a PFC circuit with an extended voltage gain. Additionally, to operate totem-pole boost converter 100 of  Figure 1  in a bidirectional power-flow mode, diodes D1 and D2 of the half-bridge leg are replaced with controlled switches (i.e., synchronous rectifiers). Furthermore, some applications require a higher gain in the regulated DC output voltage, especially when the PFC circuit operates under a low AC input voltage. One way to achieve the extended voltage gain is illustrated in  Figure 2  by AC-DC boost converter 200, which exemplifies a half-bridge PFC topology. AC-DC boost converter 200 has the advantage that, at any given time, only one of switches S1 and S2 is in the input current path, which further reduces conduction losses. AC-DC boost converter 200 has another advantage in a low input voltage application in which the DC output voltage is at least twice the peak AC input voltage.

In response to detecting the third input: in accordance with a determination that the third input by the third contact meets enhanced-navigation-gesture criteria, wherein enhanced-navigation-gesture criteria require a movement of the third contact across the touch-sensitive surface that crosses the boundary of the predefined edge region of the touch-sensitive surface (in a first predefined direction (e.g., upward)) and one or more additional conditions in order for the enhanced-navigation-gesture criteria to be met, the device ceases to display the first user interface of the first application and displays the respective other user interface (e.g., a home screen user interface, an application switcher user interface, a user interface of another application, or a control panel user interface), irrespective of whether the first application is determined to be protected. In response to detecting the third input: in accordance with a determination that the third input by the third contact does not meet the enhanced-navigation-gesture criteria and the application is protected, the device maintains display the first user interface of the first application; and in accordance with a determination that the third input by the third contact does not meet the enhanced-navigation-gesture criteria and the application is not protected, the device ceases to display the first user interface of the first application and displaying the respective other user interface (e.g., a home screen user interface, an application switcher user interface, a user interface of another application, or a control panel user interface).

In some embodiments, two consecutive short swipes that are in the bottom edge region of the touch-screen also dismiss the current user interface and display the home screen, irrespective of whether the application is determined to be a protected application or not. In some embodiments, a similar process is used by the device to determine whether or not to display an application switcher in response to a swipe input that starts from an edge of the device and moves onto the device from the edge of the device (e.g., as described in greater detail with reference to method 600) or to switch between different applications or a control panel user interface in response to a swipe input that moves along an edge of the device (e.g., as described in greater detail with reference to method 700 and 800).

However, most typical automated stores are not designed to appropriately store and sell fresh food or products with a short shelf life or even instant cooked food. Providing fresh products is important to satisfying genuine customer needs. The inventions described herein can provide a temperature-controlled delivery operation cycle. According to one aspect of the invention, a temperature-controlled cart provides an enclosed and protective storage environment for the transportation of items (particularly perishable or temperature-sensitive items) from a point of origin (e.g. a temperature controlled room in a packing or distribution warehouse) to a destination (e.g. an automated store). The cart provides different storage zones that can be separately customised or configured to provide different storage environments (e.g. in terms of different storage temperatures, air flow, physical item protection etc.) to ensure that items within the cart are stored under appropriate conditions to help ensure its freshness (or minimising changes to its state) during the transportation process. Upon arrival at an automated store, temperature-controlled carts are moved into a replenishment zone where item retrieval systems (e.g. AMR) transports containers containing the transported items to appropriate storage shelf locations within the automated store. The storage shelf locations can be separately customised or configured to provide different storage environments (e.g. in terms of different storage temperatures, air flow, physical item protection etc) to ensure that items within the cart are stored under appropriate conditions to help ensure its freshness (or minimising undesirable changes to its storage state). Alternatively, the storage shelf locations can be located in different temperature-controlled zones (or rooms) that provide different appropriate storage environments for such items. In this way, temperature-sensitive or perishable items can be stored in an appropriate or optimum storage environment to ensure freshness (or minimise degradation) of the items prior to sale.

For example, referencing  Figure 68 , an invalidation graph 6606 consistent with the dependency graph 6604 is depicted. The invalidation graph 6606 is organized with a first value in the first column, and values in a second column within the document 6406 that are no longer valid after the change in the first value. It can be seen that the relationships within the invalidation graph 6606 do not require tracing through the entire dependency graph 6604 in response to a change in a value, and can therefore enable more efficient updating of result values and/or the executable object 6502 than the use of the dependency graph 6604 alone. The organization of the invalidation graph 6606 is non-limiting, and any virtual conceptualization of invalidation checks for the document 6406 are contemplated herein. Referencing  Figure 68 , a pared invalidation graph 6606 removes certain redundant invalidation checks, yet still provides for sufficient invalidation checks according to the dependency graph 6604 of  Figure 67 . For example, a check of data value B in response to a change in data value A is redundant, as data value A affects data value B through the operation of formula A. [should we say somewhere here how this improves the functioning of the computer?] Therefore, a redundant check is eliminated in the pared invalidation graph 6606 depicted in  Figure 68 . Referencing  Figure 69 , yet another pared invalidation graph 6606 is depicted, removing certain duplicative checks still further relative to the pared invalidation graph 6606 of  Figure 68 . For example, although data value A invalidates data value D, that check is duplicative as data value A also invalidates data value B, which also invalidates data value D. Accordingly, the relationship between data value A and data value D is a duplicative check, which can be removed to save processor and recalculation time. It can be seen additionally that the order of calculations can affect the invalidation order and the operations. For example, if data value A is changed, and data value D is changed in response, then data value D will need to be recalculated again after the data value B is updated. Accordingly, the invalidation graph 6606 and recalculation order is selected, in certain embodiments, to reduce the number of invalidation checks and recalculation operations, such as by completing the recalculation of data value B before recalculating data value D. An example unified document surface application circuit 6216 further interprets a user edit value 6602, and formula engine 6302 further updates the executable object 6502 and/or recalculates result values in response to the user edit value 6602 and the pared invalidation graph 6606.", "true_sdg": "SDG12", "predicted_sdg": "SDG12", "is_correct": true, "prediction_time": 0.9757099151611328, "line_number": 1599}

However, keeping a wireless interface active for extended periods of time may result in the battery or power source of the device being depleted faster than anticipated or desired, making it difficult to use the device for extended periods of time without having to recharge the battery/power source, or without having to replace the battery (in devices featuring replaceable batteries/power sources). Accordingly, activities such as wireless scanning may be offloaded by the smaller wireless communication device to a proxy device having a larger power reserve, e.g., a larger device like a phone, tablet, portable computer, or another small device with greater charge, just to name a few examples. For example, BLUETOOTH™ and/or Wi-Fi scanning may be offloaded from a device with a smaller power reserve/source to a co-located device that has a greater power reserve.

As a result, the scans conducted by the wireless communication device with the larger power reserve may be leveraged to assist the device with the smaller power reserve.

{"patent_number": "EP3786627A1", "description_number": 23, "description_text": "From the viewpoint mentioned above, the inactive film 5 is, for example, as shown in  FIG. 2 , preferably formed at a part of the gas sensitive portion 3. For example, the inactive film 5 preferably is an island-shaped film on the gas sensitive portion 3, which is formed in an early stage of a film formation such as gas-phase processing, or a porous film having many (or innumerable) pinholes on the gas sensitive portion 3, which is formed in an stage before further growing into a uniform film. By providing the inactive film 5 at a part of the gas sensitive portion 3, it is possible to suppress the decline of the response characteristic and/or response recovery characteristic of the gas sensitive portion 3 to the hydrogen gas while maintaining the hydrogen selectivity of the MEMS type semiconductor gas detection element 1 within a predetermined range. The cause of this can be considered as follows. As mentioned above, since the inactive film suppresses permeation of the gases other than hydrogen gas, the inactive film might limit an escape of water molecules out of the gas sensitive portion, which may be generated by the chemical reaction that causes the resistance value change of the gas sensitive portion. If the water molecules remain on the surface of the gas sensitive portion or in the inactive film, the adsorption of oxygen molecules, which is required for a reaction causing the resistance value change of the gas sensitive portion, is also limited. In the case of a coil type semiconductor gas detection element, since sufficient heating process can be performed even with a thick inactive film being provided, it is possible to facilitate desorption of the water molecules. However, in the case of a MEMS type semiconductor gas detection element, it is considered that it is difficult to perform sufficient desorption of the water molecules since it is not possible to perform sufficient heat processing for achieving low power consumption for driving. If the water molecules remain on the surface of the gas sensitive portion or in the inactive film, the response characteristic and/or response recovery characteristic to the hydrogen gas may decline. In the MEMS type semiconductor gas detection element 1 of the embodiment, it is considered that since the inactive film 5 is formed at a part of the gas sensitive portion 3, the passage of the water molecules and oxygen molecules can be facilitated at least at a location where the inactive film 5 is not provided, and the limitation of the passage of the water molecules and oxygen molecules can be suppressed as a whole, allowing suppression of the decline of the response characteristic and/or response recovery characteristic to the hydrogen gas.", "true_sdg": "None", "predicted_sdg": "SDG12", "is_correct": false, "prediction_time": 0.8787477016448975, "line_number": 1698}
